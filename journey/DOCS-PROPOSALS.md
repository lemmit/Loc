# Docs updates & fixes — harvested from the build journey

Everything below is grounded in the five-stage journey (`journey/*.ddd`,
`FINDINGS.md`): the places a real user *got lost*, and the good features that
work today but aren't taught where you'd look for them. Each item says what's
wrong or missing, where it lives, the fix, and status.

Two are already shipped (marked **DONE**) — listed so the record is complete.

---

## Tier 1 — doc-rot (factually wrong; fix directly)

### DR1 — `crudish` "create/delete deferred" — **DONE** (`b0bc9ca`)
`docs/scaffold-macros.md` claimed *"`create` and `delete` are deferred… `crudish`
only emits `update`."* Verified false: `crudish` emits `create(...)`,
`update(...)`, and `destroy {}` today. Fixed: prose, the source-equivalent block
(which also carried a no-longer-parsing `this.` update lvalue), the per-surface
field rule, the `updateOnly` flag, and the summary bullet.

### DR2 — `auth-capabilities.ddd` header: "Hono doesn't compile query filters"
`web/src/examples/auth-capabilities.ddd:3-6` says *"Hono/Phoenix carry the IR but
don't yet compile the query filters."* Stage 4 verified the **node/Hono** backend
emits the per-request tenant filter *and* the soft-delete filter today
(`where(and(…, eq(projects.tenantId, requireCurrentUser().tenantId), not(eq(isDeleted, true))))`).
**Fix:** re-verify Phoenix on fresh `main`, then correct the header — at minimum
drop "Hono" from the exclusion; scope the caveat to whichever backends are still
actually IR-only. Cross-check the same claim in `docs/capabilities.md` (the
header points readers there).

**Why it matters:** this is the exact "docs move slower than code" trap CLAUDE.md
warns about — a stale header tells a user a shipped feature doesn't exist.

---

## Tier 2 — discoverability (features that work but aren't taught where you look)

### DC1 — Overriding a scaffolded page — **DONE** (`b0bc9ca`)
Override-by-name (write your own `page Detail` in the matching `area`; it replaces
the scaffolded one, siblings stay scaffolded) now has its own section in
`docs/scaffold-macros.md`, with override-vs-unfold guidance. This is the single
most important "graduate from no-code" mechanism, and the doc had never described
it — the whole reason the journey's Stage 5 nuked the scaffold instead of poking
one hole in it.

### DC2 — Aggregate construction asymmetry (`X { }` vs `X.create({ })`)
The first off-happy-path surprise (Friction #1): value objects/entity parts are
built with `X { … }`, aggregate roots with `X.create({ … })`. #2005 now catches
the mistake with a targeted diagnostic, **but no doc teaches the rule or the
why** (an aggregate has identity + invariants the factory enforces; a value
object is a plain literal). `docs/language.md` covers the `create` factory
*mechanics* but never contrasts the two construction forms.
**Fix:** a short "Constructing values vs. aggregates" note in `docs/language.md`
(near the create-factory section ~L348) and/or `docs/actions.md`, with both
forms side by side. Pairs naturally with the diagnostic.

### DC3 — One place for "which fields land in which payload"
Frictions #4 (managed field rejected from `.create()`) and #5 (scaffold rendered
`internal`/`secret` fields the api-read DTO omits) are the same missing knowledge:
the access-modifier → payload projection matrix. It exists today but **scattered**
— `docs/capabilities.md` (`forCreateInput`), `docs/generators.md` (the factory),
`docs/tenancy.md` (`internal` off create inputs). No single table answers "does
field X appear in create-input / update / api-read / full wire?"
**Fix:** one canonical table (in `docs/payloads.md` or the `docs/language.md`
access-modifier section) with a row per modifier
(`editable`/`immutable`/`managed`/`token`/`internal`/`secret`) × column per
surface (create · update · api-read · wire), and every other mention links to it.
This table alone would have pre-empted the two most expensive journey findings.

### DC4 — "Pit of success" advisories should be advertised
Two lovely nudges surfaced only by hitting them: the **index-suggestion**
advisory (`'Task.status' is read on a query filter but has no index. Consider
'index: Task.status'`) and the **bespoke-finder nudge** (steering a raw
`find byX(): T[]` toward a `criterion` + `Repo.run` / `retrieval`). Neither is
documented, so users don't know to expect or trust them.
**Fix:** a short "Advisories the compiler gives you" subsection in
`docs/criterion.md` / `docs/tools.md` listing the taste-enforcing warnings and
what each steers you toward.

---

## Tier 3 — workflow mental-model

### WF1 — `parse` ≠ `generate` (the late IR gate)
Friction #2: `ddd parse` reported 0 errors on an un-queryable retrieval; only
`ddd generate` caught it (the check lives in phase ⑦ IR-validate, which `parse`
doesn't run). `docs/tools.md:147` says *"`ddd parse` exits non-zero if the source
has errors"* — technically true but misleading: **parse runs AST validation only;
cross-aggregate / queryability / wire checks run at generate.** So parse-green ≠
model-valid.
**Fix:** one clarifying paragraph in `docs/tools.md` — parse = phases ①–④,
generate adds ⑤–⑨, so `generate` (or a `tsc` on the output) is the real gate in
an edit loop. Reinforces the "compile the emitted target" discipline the journey
proved essential.

---

## Tier 4 — papercuts

### PC1 — Field-separator convention (comma vs newline)
Hit three times: `event E { a: T, b: U }` uses commas; `aggregate A { a: T \n b: U }`
rejects them; a `deployable` flips to newline-only once a field uses the
`ui: Board { Work: api }` brace binding. **Fix:** document the actual rule per
construct in `docs/language.md` (a small table), or — better — link to the
grammar-reconciliation item already tracked as **P3** in `journey/PROPOSALS.md`
and fix it at the source instead of documenting the wart.

---

## Tier 5 — the meta-doc that ties it together

### META — "Graduating from no-code: the customization gradient"
The journey's central proof has no home in the docs: the smooth path from
`with scaffold(…)` (everything) → **override-by-name** (one bespoke page, rest
scaffolded) → **unfold** (materialise a scaffolded body and edit it) → fully
hand-written pages → the *same* `ui` served to multiple frontend frameworks. Each
piece is now documented in isolation; nothing walks the whole gradient end to end,
which is exactly the promise ("start no-code, end with no excuses") a new user is
evaluating.
**Fix:** a new short guide (e.g. `docs/customization-gradient.md`, linked from
`docs/README.md` and `docs/page-metamodel.md`) that walks the four rungs with a
running example, and states the "compile the emitted target is the real gate"
discipline. The journey files + `FINDINGS.md` are a ready-made worked example to
link as the long-form companion.

## Suggested order

1. **DR2** (stale, actively misleading — one edit).
2. **DC3** (the payload-projection table — highest leverage; kills the #4/#5
   class of surprise).
3. **DC2** + **WF1** (small, high-value mental-model notes).
4. **META** (the gradient guide — the narrative capstone; can link everything
   above).
5. **DC4**, **PC1** (nice-to-haves; PC1 ideally becomes a grammar fix, not a doc).

DR1 and DC1 already shipped in `b0bc9ca`.
