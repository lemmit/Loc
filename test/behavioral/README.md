# Headless behavioral test tier

Boots the **generated** Hono backend on **PGlite** (Postgres-in-WASM,
in-process — no docker, no separate Postgres) and runs the suites Loom
**emits** from the DSL:

- **api** — the generated `e2e/<Sys>.e2e.test.ts` (from `test e2e "…"
  against <node backend>`), dispatched straight into `app.fetch`.
  (`run.mjs`)
- **unit** — the generated pure-domain `*.test.ts` (from aggregate
  `test "…"` blocks). (`run.mjs`)
- **ui** — the generated `*.ui.spec.ts` (from `test e2e "…" against
  <react-deployable>`): real Playwright page-object round-trips against
  the `vite build`-built React frontend wired to the backend.
- **python** — the SAME emitted api e2e, but run against a booted
  **generated FastAPI backend** over real HTTP (`run-python.mjs`, corpus
  `corpus-python.json` + `corpus-python/`). Python has no in-process
  Postgres, so this needs a real DB (`DATABASE_URL`); the emitted api
  suite is backend-agnostic (HTTP contract), so the runner just swaps
  `app.fetch` for `fetch(BASE + path)`. Its own `behavioral-e2e-python.yml`
  workflow (a `services: postgres` sidecar) — the A6.2 second backend for
  the runtime-semantics RS-rules (see `docs/conformance-semantics.md` and
  `docs/plans/a6.2-behavioral-tier-second-backend.md`). Needs `uv` + a
  reachable `DATABASE_URL`; run: `node run-python.mjs`.
  (`run-ui.mjs` — see below.)

## Why

The behavioral domain assertions otherwise run **only nightly**, in the
docker `conformance-full` leg (`LOOM_E2E=1`). Everything per-PR is
*structural* — typecheck / build / lint / string-match generator tests
(`expect(out).toContain(...)`) — which proves code is *emitted*, not that
it *behaves*. This tier promotes the behavioral layer (for the Hono/TS
backend + pure domain) to a **fast, per-PR, docker-free gate**.

It reuses the **playground's own** runners (`web/src/testing/*`,
`web/src/runtime/ddl.ts`) and the same `createHarness()` the in-browser
*Tests* tab uses — so the node tier and the browser tier share one
execution path. The cross-backend (.NET/Java/Phoenix/Python) and
cross-pack UI behavioral coverage stays in the docker/nightly legs; this
tier is *additive*.

## Run

```bash
cd test/behavioral
npm ci                 # once — pins the generated-project runtime deps (isolated from the repo's)
node run.mjs           # whole corpus
node run.mjs sales-system    # one case
```

The repo toolchain must be built first (`npm run build` at the root) so
`bin/cli.js generate system` emits current output — a **stale `out/`**
will generate old code and produce misleading failures.

Both tiers gate: any `api` or `unit` failure, or a boot/infra error,
fails the run.

## Corpus

`corpus.json` is a curated allowlist. **Constraint:** each system has
exactly one `platform: node` (Hono) deployable, so dispatch
(host-agnostic, path-matched, like the playground) is unambiguous.
Multi-backend systems (`examples/showcase.ddd`, `examples/acme.ddd`)
stay in the docker `conformance-full` leg.

## Definition-of-Done rollup

After running, each case joins its outcomes onto the generated
requirements graph (`.loom/traceability.json`) via the same
`computeVerification` (`src/verify/`) the playground Tests tab uses, and
prints a per-system verdict line:

```
⟐ requirements: 2/4 verified, 2 unverified
```

- **verified** — every linked testCase passed.
- **unverified** — a linked test didn't run in *this* runner (e.g. a
  `against <web>` UI testCase is unverified under `run.mjs`, and an
  `against <api>` testCase is unverified under `run-ui.mjs`). The two
  runners are complementary: `run.mjs` verifies the api/unit testCases,
  `run-ui.mjs` verifies the UI ones. Does **not** fail the run.
- **untested** — requirement has no testCase at all.
- **FAILING** — a linked test failed. **Fails the run** (a cross-check on
  top of the per-test gate).

So the rollup surfaces requirement coverage honestly without false-gating
on coverage the node tier can't provide.

## How it works

Per case: `generate system` → locate the one node deployable → esbuild
bundles a tiny boot entry (its `createApp` + `schema` + drizzle/pglite +
the repo's `synthDDL`/runners) → PGlite → `exec(synthDDL)` →
`drizzle(pglite,{schema})` → `createApp(db)` → run the emitted suites
against `app.fetch`. All third-party deps stay external (resolved from
this dir's `node_modules`), so there is one drizzle instance and PGlite's
wasm assets load normally.

## UI tier (`run-ui.mjs`)

The sibling runner for the **`ui`** tier — the emitted Playwright spec
Loom lowers from `test e2e "…" against <react-deployable>` (page-object
round-trips: `ui.orders.create(...)` → submit → read back). It exercises
the generated React pages/forms end to end against the real backend —
behaviour the in-process `app.fetch` api tier can't reach.

```bash
cd test/behavioral
npm ci                     # same deps as the api tier (adds nothing)
node run-ui.mjs            # every corpus case with `"ui": true`
node run-ui.mjs sales-system
```

Per case: `generate system` → `vite build` the generated React frontend
→ boot **one** in-process node HTTP server that serves the built `dist/`
**and** the generated Hono backend on PGlite (`/api`, `/health`, `/ready`
delegated straight to `app.fetch`) → run the emitted `*.ui.spec.ts` with
headless Chromium pointed at it.

Two non-obvious invariants make the wiring work (both were dead ends
first):

- **One origin, no proxy.** The browser, the static bundle, and the
  backend all share the single server's origin, so there's no `vite
  preview` proxy hop and no CORS. (`/api/*` is matched first and handed
  to `app.fetch`; everything else is static with an `index.html`
  fallback for client routes.)
- **Async `spawn`, never `spawnSync`.** Playwright is launched with async
  `spawn`: `spawnSync` blocks the node event loop, which would freeze the
  in-process server so every browser request hangs.

It sidesteps the playground's in-browser npm bundle entirely (and so
issue #1242). Heavier than the api/unit tiers (a real `npm install` of
the React/Mantine tree + `vite build` + a Chromium download), so it's
opt-in — its own `behavioral:ui` script and `behavioral-ui-e2e.yml`
workflow, never part of the fast `npm test`. Corpus cases without a
`test e2e … against <react>` block carry `"ui": false`.
