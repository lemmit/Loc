## TL;DR

Loom already has the **publish** half of a messaging system and the
**transport slots** for it — it's missing the contract that ties delivery
semantics to a transport, and the realtime path to the UI.

- Producers already `emit Event { … }`; events drain through a pluggable
  `DomainEventDispatcher` (default no-op) at repository-save and
  workflow-exit (`docs/workflow.md`). **The publish side ships today.**
- `storage { type: redis | kafka | rabbitmq }` already parse + validate
  (`docs/architecture.md`); they're transport slots with no wiring yet.
- `bounded-context-model.md` already pins *who may subscribe to what*
  (context-level events are published; aggregate-nested are BC-internal)
  and names the consumer form `on(e: Event)` + `projection`.

The one thing missing is a way to say **"this set of events, delivered
*this way*, over *that* transport."** This proposal adds exactly one new
declaration — `channel` — plus its physical binding `channelSource`,
mirroring the existing `storage` / `dataSource` split (D-STORAGE-SPLIT).

**One declaration, three orthogonal knobs.** A `channel` is a named
transport+policy overlay over a set of event subjects, declared **inside the
context that owns those events** — one context normally has several (see
[Granularity](#granularity--many-channels-per-context)):

```ddd
context Orders {
  event OrderPlaced { order: Order id, at: datetime }
  // … OrderShipped, OrderCancelled …

  channel Lifecycle {             // a context member — many per context
    carries:   OrderPlaced, OrderShipped, OrderCancelled
    delivery:  broadcast          // broadcast | queue       (NATS "delivery group")
    retention: log                // ephemeral | log | work  (NATS "stream retention")
    key:       order              // ordering / partition key (a field on the carried events)
  }
}
```

Flip `delivery` / `retention` and the *same* declaration expresses pub/sub,
a work queue, or a durable replayable stream — the NATS insight that subject
and stream are orthogonal, reduced to two knobs. **The channel contract names
no transport.** Whether an event reaches a peer backend over in-process calls,
Redis, Kafka, or RabbitMQ — and whether it reaches a *browser* over SSE or a
WebSocket — is chosen **at the binding / platform**, not in the contract, so
the same channel runs in-process under test and over Kafka in prod, exactly as
a `context` runs over `inMemory` then `postgres`. SSE-vs-WebSocket is the same
kind of infrastructural choice as Redis-vs-Kafka; it never appears on the
`channel`.

## The question, in Loom's terms

The five-primitive messaging model (subject / subscription / delivery-group
/ stream / reply-subject) was designed for *untyped, string-addressed*
brokers like NATS. Loom is typed and layered, so the five collapse to three:

| General primitive | Loom home | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject** (addressable name) | the typed `event` + its `context` namespace — no free-form strings | **exists** |
| **Stream** + **Retention** | `channel { retention: … }`, bound to `storage{type:kafka/redis}` via `channelSource` | this proposal |
| **Subscription** | `on(e: Event)` reactor / `projection` | pinned by `bounded-context-model.md`; transport supplied here |
| **Delivery group** | `channel { delivery: queue }` | this proposal |
| **Reply subject** (async RPC) | — | **deferred** — synchronous `api` already covers request/reply |

So the "good abstraction over queues of different kinds" is: **`event`
(the subject, already typed) + `channel` (subscription + stream + retention
+ delivery-group, as orthogonal knobs) + `channelSource` (the transport
binding).** Three concepts, because Loom's type system and layering already
carry the rest.

### Why one declaration with knobs, not three keywords

A naïve mapping gives separate `topic` / `queue` / `stream` declarations.
That triples the surface and forces authors to re-pick a keyword when
requirements change (a broadcast topic that later needs durability becomes a
*different declaration*). The orthogonal-knob model — `delivery` ⟂
`retention` — is the whole reason NATS JetStream unifies Kafka, RabbitMQ,
and Redis PubSub behind one API. We keep that property: changing a
requirement flips a knob, not a keyword.

| `delivery` | `retention` | Behaviour | Classic equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `broadcast` | `ephemeral` | every live subscriber gets each event; nothing kept | Redis PubSub, Phoenix.PubSub |
| `broadcast` | `log`       | durable, replayable, many independent readers | Kafka topic |
| `queue`     | `ephemeral` | one of N competing consumers handles each event | RabbitMQ, SQS |
| `queue`     | `work`      | durable until acked, then deleted | RabbitMQ work queue, SQS, Kafka consumer group |

`retention: log` + a cursor is exactly event-sourcing replay — and Loom
already has the `eventLog` persistence kind and `apply(…)` appliers
(`docs/architecture.md`, `workflow-and-applier.md`) to consume it.

## Relationship to existing proposals (what this does and doesn't touch)

| Already pinned / proposed elsewhere | This proposal |
|---|---|
| **Placement = visibility.** Context-level events published; aggregate-nested internal (`bounded-context-model.md`, `loom.cross-bc-internal-event`). | Unchanged. A `channel` may only `carries:` **published** (context-level) events; carrying an aggregate-internal event reuses that same error. |
| **Consumer form** `on(e: Event)` + `projection` (`bounded-context-model.md` §"Pattern B", `workflow-and-applier.md` §Sagas). | Unchanged surface. We define the **transport** those consumers ride on and the delivery-group semantics (`queue`) that govern competing consumers. |
| **`.loom/asyncapi.yaml` — "events as channels"** (`bounded-context-model.md`). | A `channel` declaration becomes the explicit AsyncAPI channel object (bindings, retention) instead of one synthesised per event. |
| **`persistedAs(eventLog)` is a context/domain decision; `dataSource` is the system binding** (`docs/architecture.md`). | Exact precedent for the split here: `channel` (delivery/retention contract) lives **in the context**; `channelSource` (physical broker) lives at system scope. |
| **Producer** `emit Event { … }` → `DomainEventDispatcher` (`docs/workflow.md`). | **Unchanged.** Producers never name a channel. Routing is derived: the dispatcher publishes each event to every channel that `carries:` it. |

The net new surface is small: one declaration (`channel`), one binding
(`channelSource`), two consumer additions already foreshadowed (`on` reactor
gets a transport; `projection` gets defined), and a UI `.live` subscription
ref. Realtime push to the browser needs **no** contract knob — it's derived
from a UI subscribing to a channel, and the SSE-vs-WebSocket wire is platform
infra (see [Realtime](#websockets--sse--an-infrastructural-concern-not-a-contract-knob)).

## Surface — the `channel` declaration

A **context member**, declared alongside the events it carries. A channel is
the publisher-side contract for *how a context's own events are transported* —
so it lives with them, not at system scope. There is **no `from` clause**: the
`carries:` list names events of the enclosing context, and a channel may only
carry **published** (context-level) events of *that* context. (Cross-context
fan-in is the consumer's job — a reactor/projection subscribes to several
channels — never the publisher reaching across a boundary.)

```langium
// ContextMember += Channel   (sibling of EventDecl / View, inside `context { … }`)
Channel:
    'channel' name=ID '{'
        ('carries'   ':' carries+=[EventDecl:ID] (',' carries+=[EventDecl:ID])* ','?)
        ('delivery'  ':' delivery=ChannelDelivery ','?)?
        ('retention' ':' retention=ChannelRetention ('(' retentionArg=RetentionArg ')')? ','?)?
        ('key'       ':' key=ID ','?)?            // partition/ordering key — a field common to carried events
    '}';

ChannelDelivery  returns string: 'broadcast' | 'queue';
ChannelRetention returns string: 'ephemeral' | 'log' | 'work';
// RetentionArg carries log limits: maxAge / maxBytes (deferred to a follow-up; parses as a knob list).
```

The contract carries **delivery semantics only** — what's delivered, to a
broadcast audience or a competing-consumer group, kept how long. It says
nothing about the wire (in-process / Redis / Kafka / RabbitMQ for backends;
SSE / WebSocket for browsers); that's `channelSource` + platform.

Defaults (when a knob is omitted) reproduce **today's behaviour** so existing
`.ddd` files are unaffected: `delivery: broadcast`, `retention: ephemeral`,
no `key`. An author who declares no `channel` at all keeps the current
in-process no-op-able dispatcher.

### Granularity — many channels per context

`carries:` *selects a subset* of the context's events; it is not a 1:1 wrapper
and it is not exhaustive. The common case is **several channels in one
context**, each grouping events that share a delivery profile — and the *same*
event may appear on more than one channel (e.g. a durable audit log **and** an
ephemeral UI feed), in which case the dispatcher fans it out to each:

```ddd
context Orders {
  event OrderPlaced    { order: Order id, at: datetime }
  event OrderShipped   { order: Order id, at: datetime }
  event StockLevel     { sku: string, onHand: int }          // high-volume telemetry
  event PaymentCapture { order: Order id, amount: decimal }  // must-process-once

  // durable, replayable lifecycle log — read models replay it
  channel Lifecycle { carries: OrderPlaced, OrderShipped; retention: log; key: order }

  // fire-and-forget metrics — ephemeral broadcast (a dashboard UI can go .live on it)
  channel Telemetry { carries: StockLevel; delivery: broadcast; retention: ephemeral }

  // competing-consumer work queue — one worker captures each payment
  channel Payments  { carries: PaymentCapture; delivery: queue; retention: work; key: order }

  // OrderPlaced also rides Lifecycle above AND this ephemeral feed — fan-out, two profiles
  channel Board     { carries: OrderPlaced, OrderShipped; retention: ephemeral }
}
```

A consumer that could match an event on more than one bound channel **must**
disambiguate with `via <Channel>` (see below); `loom.reactor-channel-ambiguous`
fires otherwise. This is why reactors name a channel rather than just an event.

References elsewhere use the same name rule as every Loom cross-ref: bare when
globally unique (`Lifecycle`), dotted when not (`Orders.Lifecycle`).

**Validation** (`loom.channel-*`):

| Code | Rule |
|---|---|
| `loom.channel-internal-event` | a `carries:` event is aggregate-nested (BC-internal) — reuses the `cross-bc-internal-event` boundary. |
| `loom.channel-key-missing-field` | `key:` names a field absent from one of the carried events. |
| `loom.channel-key-type` | the `key:` field has a different type across carried events (no common partition key). |
| `loom.channel-retention-needs-key` | `retention: work` or `log` with `delivery: queue` requires a `key:` for stable per-key ordering (warning). |
| `loom.ui-live-on-queue` | a UI goes `.live` on a `delivery: queue` channel (a browser can't join a competing-consumer group) — error: subscribe to a `broadcast` channel carrying the same event. Lives in the UI/realtime checks, not on the channel. |

## Surface — consumers (the transport under an already-pinned form)

The consumer keywords are pinned elsewhere; here is how they bind to a
channel. A reactor is **a workflow that starts on an event instead of an
HTTP POST** — so it reuses the entire workflow body vocabulary and lowering
(`docs/workflow.md`), which is the single biggest implementation saving.

```ddd
context Shipping {

  // Reactor / policy — choreography. `on(e: Event)` is the form pinned by
  // bounded-context-model.md; `via Orders.Lifecycle` selects the channel (and
  // thus the delivery group); omitted ⇒ derived when exactly one bound channel
  // carries the event. Body = workflow body (let / create / op-call / emit).
  on(e: OrderPlaced) via Orders.Lifecycle {
    let shipment = Shipment.create({ order: e.order, status: Pending })
    emit ShipmentRequested { shipment: shipment.id, at: now() }
  }

  // Projection — write side of a read model, folded from a channel.
  // Reuses apply()-style pure fold discipline (workflow-and-applier.md).
  projection OrderBook from Orders.Lifecycle {
    on OrderPlaced(e)   { upsert { order: e.order, status: Placed } }
    on OrderShipped(e)  { set status = Shipped where order = e.order }
  }
}
```

```langium
// ContextMember += Reactor | Projection
Reactor:
    'on' '(' param=ID ':' event=[EventDecl:ID] ')' ('via' channel=[Channel:ID])?
    '{' body+=Statement* '}';            // body = the existing Workflow Statement rules
```

Delivery-group identity for `delivery: queue` channels defaults to the
reactor's qualified name, so N replicas of one deployable form one competing-
consumer group automatically; `broadcast` channels deliver to every replica.
No extra DSL — replica count is a deployment fact, the channel knob is the
only switch.

**Validation:** `loom.reactor-event-uncarried` (the reacted event is carried
by no channel the hosting deployable binds), `loom.reactor-channel-mismatch`
(`via X` where `X` doesn't carry the event), `loom.reactor-channel-ambiguous`
(no `via` but the event is carried by more than one bound channel — name one),
plus the inherited `cross-bc-internal-event`.

## Surface — transport binding (`channelSource`)

The channel is **transport-neutral** — like every other Loom contract, it
names no platform or broker. Binding to a physical `storage` mirrors
`dataSource` exactly (D-STORAGE-SPLIT): a sibling declaration, listed on the
deployable.

```ddd
storage bus     { type: redis }       // ephemeral pub/sub + lightweight streams
storage eventLog { type: kafka }      // durable, partitioned, replayable

channelSource lifecycleBus { for: Orders.Lifecycle, use: eventLog }  // qualified channel ref
channelSource paymentsBus  { for: Orders.Payments,  use: bus      }

deployable salesApi {
  platform:    hono
  contexts:    [Orders]
  serves:      SalesApi
  dataSources: [ordersState]
  channels:    [lifecycleBus, paymentsBus]   // one binding per channel this deployable wires
  port:        3000
}
```

The default — **no `channelSource`** — keeps the in-process dispatcher
(today's behaviour, ideal for a monolith and for tests). Adding a binding is
what activates a broker. A channel may bind to different transports in
different deployables/environments without touching the contract or the
domain.

### Transport compatibility matrix (the answer table, in Loom terms)

`channelSource` validates the channel's `delivery`×`retention` against the
bound `storage.type`, the same way `dataSource` validates `kind` against
`storage.type` today:

| `delivery` | `retention` | Compatible `storage.type` | UI-subscribable (`.live`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `broadcast` | `ephemeral` | `inMemory`, `redis` | yes |
| `broadcast` | `log`       | `kafka` | yes (replay-from-cursor) |
| `queue`     | `ephemeral` | `redis`, `rabbitmq` | no — competing consumers |
| `queue`     | `work`      | `redis`, `rabbitmq`, `kafka` | no — competing consumers |

`loom.channelsource-incompatible` fires on a mismatch (e.g. `retention: work`
bound to a bare `inMemory` with no durability), carrying the same
suggestion-with-alternatives shape as the existing dataSource matrix error.
Note the last column is a *semantic* property (a browser can't join a work
group) — **not** a transport choice; SSE-vs-WebSocket doesn't appear here.

## WebSockets / SSE — an infrastructural concern, not a contract knob

SSE and WebSocket are two wire formats for the same thing: pushing a
`broadcast` channel's events to a browser. The delivery semantics are
identical, so the **`channel` says nothing about which is used** — just as it
says nothing about Redis-vs-Kafka. A channel becomes UI-observable simply
because a UI *subscribes* to it; nothing is declared on the producer side.

```ddd
ui WebApp {
  api     Sales:  SalesApi
  channel Orders: Orders.Lifecycle     // subscribe — wire format is derived, not stated

  page OrderBoard {
    route: "/board"
    // .live: the list re-fetches / patches its cache when Orders carries a
    // relevant event — instead of polling.
    body: For { Sales.Order.all.live, o => Card { o.id, o.status } }
  }

  // Explicit notification handler (toast, badge, navigate).
  on Orders.OrderShipped(e) { toast("Order " + e.order + " shipped") }
}
```

**Where the wire format is decided.** Derived from the frontend's platform,
with an optional override at the *deployable* — the same tier as `port:`, an
infra fact:

| Frontend platform | Default wire | Why |
|---|---|---|
| React (`static` target) | **SSE** | one-way server→client fits `.live` invalidation; survives proxies; no upgrade handshake. |
| Phoenix LiveView | **native WebSocket** | LiveView already holds a socket; reusing it is free. |

```ddd
deployable webApp {
  platform: static
  targets:  salesApi
  ui:       WebApp { Sales: salesApi }
  realtime: websocket        // optional infra override; default SSE for React. NOT on the channel.
  port:     3002
}
```

So `realtime:` exists in the grammar, but on the **deployable** (infra),
never on the `channel` (contract). Most authors never write it.

```langium
// UiMember += UiChannelParam ; plus a `.live` query suffix and `on Param.Event(p){…}` handler
UiChannelParam: 'channel' name=ID ':' channel=[Channel:ID];
UiNotification:  'on' param=[UiChannelParam:ID] '.' event=[EventDecl:ID]
                 '(' bind=ID ')' '{' body+=Statement* '}';
```

Per-frontend lowering of the *same* `.live` IR:

| Platform | Realtime mechanism | `.live` lowers to |
|---|---|---|
| **React** (`hono`/`static` target) | `EventSource` (SSE) or `WebSocket` client in the generated `api/` client | subscribe in a `useEffect`; on event → `queryClient.invalidateQueries([...])` (or a targeted `setQueryData` patch keyed by `channel.key`). |
| **Phoenix LiveView** | **native** — `Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe` + `handle_info` | a `handle_info({:order_shipped, …}, socket)` that re-`assign`s the stream; LiveView diffs and pushes over its own WebSocket. No client code. |

This is where the layering pays off: Phoenix LiveView's WebSocket fabric is
*already* a channel transport, so native WebSocket is free there, while React
gets an SSE (or WS, if the deployable overrides) client generated against the
same channel contract — all from the *same* `.live` IR. The wire format is a
`PlatformSurface` capability (`realtimeWire: "sse" | "websocket"`), defaulted
per platform and overridable on the deployable; the channel and the page body
are identical regardless.

## IR, lowering, enrichment (phase mapping)

Following the `view`/`criterion`/`workflow` vertical-slice recipe:

```ts
// src/ir/types/loom-ir.ts
export interface ChannelIR {
  name: string;
  owningContext: string;             // the context this channel is declared in (carries its events)
  carries: string[];                 // event type names (resolved, this context's published events)
  delivery: "broadcast" | "queue";
  retention: "ephemeral" | "log" | "work";
  key?: string;                      // field name common to carried events
  // NO realtime/transport field — the contract is wire-agnostic.
}
// stored on BoundedContextIR.channels: ChannelIR[]  (sibling of events / views)
export interface ReactorIR {
  event: string; param: string;
  channel?: string;                  // resolved channel name (or derived)
  body: StmtIR[];                    // SAME shape as WorkflowIR.body — reuse the lowerer
}
export interface ProjectionIR { /* target read model + per-event fold (reuse ApplyIR) */ }
export interface ChannelSourceIR { channel: string; storage: string; }
// DeployableIR += channelNames: string[]
//             += realtimeWire?: "sse" | "websocket"   // infra override; defaulted by PlatformSurface
```

- **⑤ lower** — `lowerChannel` (structural, in `lower.ts`); `lowerReactor`
  delegates to the **existing workflow body lowerer** in `lower-stmt.ts`
  (`e` bound as a `param` ref typed by the event). `projection` reuses the
  applier fold lowering. No new expression machinery.
- **⑥ enrich** — derive each event's *routing set* (channels carrying it) and
  attach it to the publish side, so the dispatcher emitter knows where each
  `emit` goes. Derive, per frontend deployable, the resolved realtime wire
  (`realtimeWire` override ?? `PlatformSurface` default) and the set of
  channels any of its pages `.live`-subscribe. This is the natural sibling of
  the existing `migrationsOwner` enrichment.
- **⑦ validate** — the `loom.channel-*` / `loom.reactor-*` /
  `loom.channelsource-*` cross-cutting checks above (needs the fully-resolved
  routing graph, so it lives in phase ⑦ like the eventSourced-discipline
  check).
- **⑨ compose** — emit `.loom/asyncapi.yaml` from `ChannelIR` (replacing the
  per-event synthesis the BC-model placeholdered); add broker services
  (Redis/Kafka/RabbitMQ) to `docker-compose.yml` for every bound
  `channelSource`, alongside the existing Postgres service wiring.

**No target-backend IR.** Every backend consumes `ChannelIR` directly, per
the architectural invariant.

## Generated code, per backend (anchored on the existing seam)

The publish side already drains through `DomainEventDispatcher` /
`IDomainEventDispatcher` — **the entire Phase-1 publish path is "give that
hook a real, channel-driven implementation."** Producer code is untouched.

| Backend | Publish (dispatcher impl) | Consume (`on` reactor) | Realtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hono** | `DomainEventDispatcher` that fans an event to each carrying channel's driver: in-proc `EventEmitter` / `ioredis` pub/sub / `kafkajs` producer / `amqplib`. | per-channel subscriber loop → reuses the generated **workflow handler** for the reactor body; `queue` ⇒ consumer-group / `BLPOP`; ack on success. | Hono SSE helper (`streamSSE`) or `ws` endpoint at `/channels/<name>`; pushes carried events to subscribed browsers. |
| **.NET** | `IDomainEventDispatcher` → in-proc MediatR notification / MassTransit publish (Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka transport) — DI-registered like the existing `AddScoped` repos. | `IConsumer<T>` / `INotificationHandler<T>` invoking the reactor's Mediator command (same handler the workflow controller calls). | ASP.NET SSE (`text/event-stream`) or a SignalR hub bound to the channel. |
| **Phoenix LiveView** | `Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast` (ephemeral) / Broadway + Ash (durable). | an Ash reactor / `GenServer` `handle_info` running the reactor body as an Ash action. | **native** — LiveView `handle_info` + stream re-assign; no extra transport. |
| **React** (consumer of realtime) | — | — | generated SSE/WS client; `.live` refs invalidate/patch React Query cache keyed by `channel.key`. |

## Worked example (end to end)

```ddd
system Acme {
  subdomain Sales {
    context Orders {
      aggregate Order { customerId: Customer id; status: OrderStatus; placedAt: datetime }
      repository Orders for Order {}
      event OrderPlaced  { order: Order id, at: datetime }   // context-level ⇒ published
      event OrderShipped { order: Order id, at: datetime }
      workflow placeOrder(customerId: Customer id, at: datetime) {
        let o = Order.create({ customerId, status: Placed, placedAt: at })
        emit OrderPlaced { order: o.id, at }                 // producer — unchanged
      }

      channel Lifecycle {                                    // context member, beside its events
        carries: OrderPlaced, OrderShipped
        delivery: broadcast           // ⇒ a UI may .live-subscribe; wire format is infra
        retention: log                // durable, replayable
        key: order
      }
    }
  }
  subdomain Fulfilment {
    context Shipping {
      aggregate Shipment { order: Order id; status: ShipStatus }
      repository Shipments for Shipment {}
      on(e: OrderPlaced) via Orders.Lifecycle {             // reactor (choreography)
        let s = Shipment.create({ order: e.order, status: Pending })
      }
    }
  }

  storage eventLog { type: kafka }
  channelSource lifecycleBus { for: Orders.Lifecycle, use: eventLog }

  api SalesApi from Sales
  ui WebApp {
    api Sales: SalesApi
    channel Orders: Orders.Lifecycle
    page Board { route: "/board"
      body: For { Sales.Order.all.live, o => Card { o.id, o.status } } }
  }

  deployable salesApi  { platform: hono; contexts: [Orders];   serves: SalesApi
                         dataSources: [ordersState]; channels: [lifecycleBus]; port: 3000 }
  deployable shipApi   { platform: dotnet; contexts: [Shipping]
                         dataSources: [shipState]; channels: [lifecycleBus]; port: 8080 }
  deployable webApp    { platform: static; targets: salesApi
                         ui: WebApp { Sales: salesApi }; port: 3002 }
}
```

What the reader gets from a single declaration: the `channel` tells you the
events, delivery, and durability (no wire protocol); the `ui` `.live` ref tells
you the board observes it; the `channelSource` tells you it's Kafka; the
`deployable channels:` tells you who's wired in. The `webApp` names no
`realtime:`, so it defaults to SSE — and the `compose` step provisions a Kafka
service and an SSE endpoint, neither named in the contract.

## Slice plan (incremental, dispatcher-first)

Each slice is independently shippable and testable, mirroring the storage and
workflow slice trails.

1. **`channel` + `channelSource` surface** — grammar, scope, IR, the
   `loom.channel-*` / `channelsource-*` validators, `.loom/asyncapi.yaml`
   from `ChannelIR`. No runtime change. (One parse test, one negative
   validator test, one IR test.)
2. **In-process transport** — implement `DomainEventDispatcher` to route by
   the enriched routing set; `delivery: broadcast`/`ephemeral` only;
   in-process registry of `on(...)` reactors reusing the workflow handler.
   Hono + .NET. (`LOOM_TS_BUILD` / `dotnet-build` gates.)
3. **Redis transport** — `channelSource use: redis`; pub/sub (`broadcast`)
   and `BLPOP`/streams (`queue`); compose service. Per-backend driver.
4. **UI `.live` over SSE (React)** — derived SSE endpoint + generated client +
   `.live` cache invalidation; `realtimeWire` defaulting on `PlatformSurface`.
   No channel-contract change. (`LOOM_REACT_BUILD`.)
5. **Phoenix-native realtime + WebSocket override** — `Phoenix.PubSub` +
   LiveView `handle_info`; the optional `deployable realtime: websocket`
   infra override. (`LOOM_PHOENIX_BUILD`.)
6. **Kafka + `retention: log`** — durable streams, partition by `key`,
   `projection` replay-from-cursor. (`LOOM_E2E`.)
7. **RabbitMQ / `queue` + `work`** — competing consumers, ack semantics.

## Deferred / out of scope

The model unifies the *programming surface*; it deliberately does **not**
paper over operational guarantees that genuinely differ between brokers —
the same honest line NATS draws.

- **Request/reply (reply-subject).** Synchronous `api` already covers RPC; an
  async `ask`/reply correlation knob is a later add if empirical pressure
  appears.
- **Exactly-once / cross-stream transactions.** Not unified. The outbox
  pattern (at-least-once + idempotent reactors) is the v1 guarantee; Kafka
  transactional EOS is a per-backend opt-in, not a portable contract.
- **Per-message leasing vs partition ordering.** Loom picks **partition-key
  ordering** (the `key:` knob) as the portable default; per-message leasing
  (SQS/PubSub-style) is exposed only when bound to a transport that offers it.
- **Schema versioning of carried events.** Inherits the BC-model's Level-1
  (convention + `.loom/asyncapi.yaml` diff) stance; Level-2/3 deferred there.
