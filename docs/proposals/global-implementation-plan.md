# Global Implementation Plan — `docs/proposals/`

> `storage-and-platform-config-micro-plan.md`, then audits the

## Context

`docs/proposals/` is the live design corpus for Loom. This plan owns
the **topological ordering** across the in-scope proposals and verifies
state against `origin/main`. For the **live per-proposal status** (every
doc, including the newer corpus that postdates this plan's original
scope), the refreshed [`README.md`](./README.md) status table is the
companion source of truth; this plan's audit tables below are kept in
sync with it.

For a short, dated digest of **only the carry-over work** (what's left,
grouped by family, with a suggested near-term order), see
[`remaining-work-plan.md`](./remaining-work-plan.md) — refreshed alongside this
plan's audit tables.

The goal is a single topological order across the in-scope proposals
that:

1. Lands a small set of mechanical refactors / seam extractions first.
2. Resolves cross-proposal collisions before any grammar lands.
3. Sequences features so downstream consumers do not undo upstream
   choices.
4. Skips or shrinks work already shipped on main.

## Audit summary — current state on `origin/main`

Major landings since the original plan was drafted:

| Landed on main | Effect on plan |
|---|---|
| WalkerTarget extraction (#607–#627; tsxTarget + heexTarget standalone; 7 seams delegated — `renderStateRead/Write`, `renderApiCall`, `renderApiHoisting`, `renderHelperImports`, `renderNavigate`, `renderMatch`) | Drop from Phase 0 — done end-to-end |
| `src/ir/wire-types.ts` (#605) — centralised wire-type dispatch | Reuse in Phase 1 / Phase 2 generators |
| named `layout` SystemMember (#609, #611) + multi-pack ports (#620) | Layouts now first-class — relevant to forms & i18n chrome |
| `component` as ModelMember (#629) + slot-typed params (#632, validator #643) | Workspace-wide components — consumed by loom-forms |
| HEEx form primitives, Phase D Slices A–D (#631, #634, #635, #636, #637) | Phoenix form primitives partially landed — slots into loom-forms backend work |
| `react: require ui:` (#606) — legacy archetype fallback removed | No more dual codepaths in later UI proposals |
| Storage adapter taxonomy + orchestrator rewire (#681–#691: F3 contracts, F5/F6/F7 real persistence/style/layout adapters + dispatch) | `persistence`/`style`/`layout` adapter seam is real on all three backends; emit dispatches through it |
| **D-ADAPTER-HOME dissolve** — central `adapter-registry.ts` removed; each backend carries its menu on its `PlatformSurface`; `resolve-adapters.ts` reads the discovered surface | Adapter contracts done. The per-deployable adapter-selection consumer has since SHIPPED (D-REALIZATION-AXES 5a–5d — backends read the `DeployableIR` axis fields directly); `resolve*` remains available for resolved-adapter callers |
| **Lifecycle Phase 1** (#722) — kind-tagged `create`/`destroy` + `creates`/`destroys`/`canonical*` IR; `urlStyle:`/`routeSlug` pinned **D-URLSTYLE** (`lifecycle-url-style.md`) | Phase 1B foundation landed; remaining lifecycle/forms phases carry over |
| **Criterion core** — declaration + body validation + compile-time inline into every bool position; **filter-capability targeting** on Hono/Drizzle (#760) + Phoenix/Ash (#762) | `criterion.md` core shipped; reified/retrieval deferred tail per its doc |
| **Aggregate inheritance I1** — abstract aggregates + `inheritanceUsing(…)` surface/IR/validators (no emission); `contains` on a TPH concrete (#768) | Track I started; I2/I3/I4 emission carry over |
| **Database seeding** — Phase 1 surface→IR→lowering (#803) + all three emitters: Drizzle (#804), EF (#805), Ash (#806) + CI gates (#808) + **D-SEED-PATH**/**D-SEED-IDEMPOTENCY**/**D-SEED-XREF** | `database-seeding.md` mostly shipped; ship-once marker + imperative body carry over |
| **Platform realization axes** — `platform:` decomposed into `transport`/`foundation`/`style`/`layout`/`persistence` (**D-REALIZATION-AXES**, phases 1–5a #809, 5b real hono/node + .NET `byFeature` #825/#830); `node` is the platform, `hono` a `transport:` value (**D-NODE-PLATFORM**); **D-PHOENIX-SURFACE** decomposed + `platform: phoenix` migration (#831) | Supersedes the framework-version-axis framing of `platform-directory-layout.md` for the realization knobs |
| **RFC 7807 `errors[]`** (`validation-error-extension.md`) — Hono (#782) + .NET (#829) emit per-field `errors[]` on 422; **frontend-acl** Phases 1+2 (#769) decoder consumes it | Phoenix `errors[]` + the `exception-less` language surface carry over |
| **extern-component Tier 1 (React)** (#802) — `component … extern` typed leaf | `extern-component-escape-hatch.md` Tier 1 shipped; Tier 2 (`action`) + LiveView carry over |
| **channels Slice 1** (#797) — `channel`/`channelSource` surface → `ChannelIR`/`ChannelSourceIR` | `channels.md` realtime wire + caching carry over |
| **retrieval** (#794 surface+IR+lowering; #810 .NET `Run<Name>Async` + workflow `foreach`; #952 Hono `run<Name>`; #955 Phoenix/Ash read action) | `retrieval.md` `Repo.run` emission shipped on all four backends; `loads` plan carries over |
| **Pagination / payload P3b** — `Paged<T>` carrier + functional paged finds on **all four backends** (#898 React, #916 .NET CQRS+EF, #925 Phoenix/Ash offset, #927 Hono nullish, #933 cross-backend wire-parity closeout) | `pagination-design-note.md` now SHIPPED (offset); `payload-transport-layer.md` P3b done — the rest of P1–P4 carry over |
| **Reified criteria (retrieval *and* find, all four backends)** — Specification reframe: .NET/EF `Criterion<T>`+`IsSatisfiedBy` (#890), `ToExpression` query face (#901), retrieval/find consume it (#910/#926), Ardalis `Specification<T>` bundle EF-only (#936); Dapper parameterised SQL (#943); Hono module-level predicate fn (retrieval #952, find #963); Phoenix/Ash `:boolean` calculation (retrieval #955, find #964) | `reified-criteria.md` now PARTIAL — retrieval + find criteria reified everywhere; capability-`filter` reification + the principal/tenancy factory carry over. Graduates `criterion.md`'s deferred selectability tail for retrievals + finds |
| **Event-sourcing appliers** — Hono create-from-event (A2.2a, #895) + **.NET/EF appliers + event store** (A2.2b, #914); members-only workflow body with `create()` starter (#889); event/payload names as workflow command param types (#932) | `workflow-and-applier.md` now PARTIAL (Hono + .NET); Phoenix backend + projections/snapshots carry over |
| **Agent tooling** — `ddd-mcp` stdio server over the tool catalog (#934) + navigational read trio (#937) + **rewrite trio** `loom_rename`/`loom_quickfix`/`loom_unfold_macro` (#940) + a **transport-neutral agent loop** (#946), riding a wave of LSP rename/references/hover correctness fixes (#913–#929) | `agent-tools-and-mcp.md` now PARTIAL (generative + MCP + full nav family + agent loop); LSP-provider correctness + playground chat UI carry over |
| **Cross-stack static analysis (Phoenix arm)** — Elixir `@spec` emission on event/VO/view/workflow modules + shared `<App>.Types` (#902/#904/#906/#911), Dialyzer CI behind `LOOM_PHOENIX_DIALYZER` (#907/#918), `LOOM_DOTNET_FORMAT`/`LOOM_PHOENIX_FORMAT` gates (#903) | `cross-stack-static-analysis.md` now PARTIAL; C# nullable + .NET analyzer + repo-content lint carry over |
| **Value-object array persistence** — `Money[]` etc. flatten to child tables across all backends (#908); migrations flatten value objects into columns (#891) | Folded into `document-and-json-hierarchies.md`'s shape axis |
| **ir/lower + ir/validate decomposition** — `lower.ts` split into per-declaration-kind leaves (#921/#923/#930/#935) + `lower-expr`/`-stmt`/`-types`; `validate.ts` split into `checks/*` (#900); .NET `cqrs-emit`→`cqrs/*` (#869), Phoenix `domain-emit`→`domain/*` (#912) | Phase 0.3 seam extractions DONE — supersedes the 0.3 split-list below |

Per-proposal state on `origin/main`:

| Proposal | State | Carry-over |
|---|---|---|
| `provenance.md` | SHIPPED (TS/Hono v1) | Deferred items only |
| `observability.md` | SHIPPED (catalog + 3 backends + `LOOM_OBS_E2E_*` gates) | None in scope |
| `audit-and-logging.md` | PARTIAL — `audited` boolean lands; Hono emits load→mutate→save→audit | Promote to `audited(actions \| access \| events \| off)`; `AuditRecord` shape; before/after snapshots; .NET Mediator behaviour; access-audit query pipeline |
| `sensitivity-and-compliance.md` | PARTIAL — phases 1 + 2-lite shipped | Phase 2 full (`authorized(<tag>,…)`); Phase 3 (`mask:` DTOs + React); Phase 4 (sink-call classification) |
| `storage-and-platform-config.md` | PARTIAL — top-level `storage` + `dataSource` + role-keyed slots + the persistence/style/layout **adapter taxonomy** (F3–F7) exist; adapters live on the `PlatformSurface` (D-ADAPTER-HOME) | **Per-deployable `persistence:` / `style:` / `layout:` selection is SHIPPED** (D-REALIZATION-AXES 5a–5d): the grammar + `DeployableIR` fields are populated and the backends consume them — .NET reads `deployable.persistence` directly (`efcore`/`dapper`), hono carries `drizzle`/`mikroorm`, plus `cqrs` style + `byLayer`/`byFeature` layout, all behind `loom.dapper-unsupported` / `loom.mikroorm-unsupported` capability gates. (Backends read the IR field directly rather than threading `resolvePersistence`, which stays available for callers that want a resolved adapter.) **Remaining tail:** logical `dataSource` bindings (`dataSources:`), the `STORAGE_CAPABILITIES` matrix, the reserved `marten` / `layered` stubs, outbox + per-deployable overrides; per-aggregate `for:` deferred to v2 (D-GRANULARITY) |
| `criterion.md` | PARTIAL — core (declaration + validation + compile-time inline) + filter-capability targeting on all SQL backends; retrieval + find criteria reified on all four backends (below) | retrieval `loads` plan/`from`/`when`/auto-`can-<op>`/`private workflow` deferred tail |
| `reified-criteria.md` | PARTIAL — retrieval + find criteria reified on all four backends: .NET/EF `Criterion<T>`+`IsSatisfiedBy` (#890), `ToExpression` (#901), find/retrieval consume it (#910/#926), Ardalis bundle (#936); Dapper SQL (#943); Hono predicate fn (retrieval #952, find #963); Phoenix/Ash calculation (retrieval #955, find #964) | capability-`filter` reification; principal/tenancy factory; `isSatisfiedBy` duality |
| `payload-transport-layer.md` / `pagination-design-note.md` | PARTIAL — `Paged<T>` carrier + paged finds on all 4 backends (P3b #898/#916/#925, #933 closeout); pagination SHIPPED for offset | P1–P4 carrier-generic surface, tagged unions, `<Agg>Wire`; `unpaged` opt-out + page-aware hooks |
| `workflow-and-applier.md` | PARTIAL — appliers (A1) + event-sourced emission on Hono (A2.1/A2.2a) and **.NET/EF (A2.2b #914)**; members-only body + `create()` (#889) | Phoenix event-sourced backend, snapshots, projections, workflow-as-aggregate `on(...)` |
| `cross-stack-static-analysis.md` | PARTIAL — Phoenix `@spec` (#902/#904/#906/#911) + Dialyzer CI (#907/#918) + format gates (#903) | C# nullable enable, .NET analyzer gate, repo-content lint |
| `agent-tools-and-mcp.md` | PARTIAL — catalog (10 tools) + MCP stdio server (#934) + read trio (#937) + rewrite trio (#940) + agent loop (#946) | LSP-provider correctness + playground agentic chat UI |
| `implicit-system-composition.md` | PARTIAL — Tiers 1 & 2 (top-level domain + deployment members compose via `lowerProject`) | per `multi-file-source.md` tail |
| `lifecycle-operations.md` | PARTIAL — Phase 1 (kind-tagged `create`/`destroy` IR, #722) + D-URLSTYLE | Phase 2+ action surface + `urlStyle:`/`routeSlug` slice |
| `aggregate-inheritance.md` | PARTIAL — I1 (surface + IR + validators, no emission) | I2 (TPH emit), I3 (TPC emit), I4 (override + TPT docs) |
| `database-seeding.md` | PARTIAL — Phase 1 + all three backend emitters + CI gates | ship-once `__loom_seed` marker + compose wiring, imperative body, per-row upsert |
| `frontend-acl.md` | PARTIAL — Phases 1+2 (#769): `applyServerErrors` + `StrictFieldMap` in every React project | schema restructure + per-action FieldMap + `option`-field rendering |
| Everything else in scope | NOT STARTED | Full per each doc's internal phasing |

## New proposals on main

| Proposal | One-line | Hard prereq | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lifecycle-operations.md` | `create` / `operation` / `destroy` keywords with kind tags on `OperationIR`; fixes the "form/API generators invent create contracts from `aggregate.fields`" layering bug | None | 5 phases, ~13 d / ~7 d parallel |
| `loom-forms.md` | `CreateForm` / `OperationForm` / `DestroyForm` walker primitives bound strictly to typed-action IR | lifecycle-operations Phase 1 | 3 phases, ~5 d |
| `i18n-strings.md` | Bans `+` in user-visible slots; mandates template literals; ICU placeholder lowering with stable content-hash keys | None | ~5 d, folds into i18n |
| `i18n.md` | First-class i18n: ICU catalogs, content-hash keys, named `text { }` entries, `ddd i18n sync` three-way merge, per-backend adapters | i18n-strings | 7 phases, ~4 weeks |
| `workflow-and-applier.md` | Ash-style `create` actions, applier separation, sagas deferred | None | TBD per proposal phasing |
| `platform-directory-layout.md` | Framework-version axis for backend code. **Option A rejected (D-BACKEND-PKG)**; backend layout follows the packaging-split (per-version packages); hono hoist stays as package-staging | packaging-split lands; gated on F-series + `node` rename | per backend, after F-series |
| `per-package-output-tree.md` | Per-layer **output** packages ("Loom as ORM"). Output-side twin of packaging-split; expressible as a `LayoutAdapter` | playground workspace support | deferred — large one-time bill |

## Newer corpus (postdates this plan's topological scope)

These proposals were authored **after** this plan's in-scope set was
frozen and are **not yet woven into the topological order** above. Their
shipped/partial state is already reflected in the audit tables; full
per-doc status lives in the refreshed [`README.md`](./README.md). They
are listed here so the plan's audit is complete, not because they have
been sequenced.

| Proposal | State on main | Sequencing note |
|---|---|---|
| `platform-realization-axes.md` | PARTIAL (phases 1–5b) — see Major landings | Pinned D-REALIZATION-AXES; supersedes the realization-knob framing of `platform-directory-layout.md` |
| `validation-error-extension.md` | PARTIAL (Hono + .NET) | Decoupled wire-format slice of `exception-less.md`; Phoenix tail remains |
| `channels.md` | PARTIAL (Slice 1) | Fills the async-messaging/caching gap; realtime + Part II caching unsequenced |
| `retrieval.md` | PARTIAL (surface+IR; emit on all four backends) | `loads` load-plan; graduates the `reified-criteria` seam |
| `database-seeding.md` | PARTIAL (Phase 1 + 3 emitters) | Mirrors the migrations pipeline; near-complete |
| `extern-component-escape-hatch.md` | PARTIAL (Tier 1, React, #802) | Open-library seam; Tier 2 / LiveView deferred |
| `extern-function-hook-escape-hatch.md` | PROPOSED | Logic twin of the component hatch; staged after it |
| `reified-criteria.md` / `criterion-everywhere.md` | PARTIAL (retrieval + find, all 4 backends) / SUPERSEDED-mechanism | The Specification-object reframe of criterion selectability — retrieval + find criteria reified everywhere; capability-`filter` reification + the principal/tenancy factory carry over |
| `render-expr-target-unification.md` | SHIPPED — `ExprTarget` contract + shared `renderExprWith` dispatcher; all three backends are leaf-only target tables (byte-identical gated) | Brought forward of A4 so A4 authors its new arms once behind the contract |
| `resource-model-and-source-types.md` + `workflow-resource-consumption.md` | PROPOSED | Generalises the data layer (object stores / queues / external APIs) |
| `bounded-context-model.md`, `embedded-frontend-composition.md`, `elixir-ecto-and-api-only-backends.md`, `document-and-json-hierarchies.md` | PROPOSED / PARTIAL | Structural / backend-matrix reframes; coordinate with storage + realization axes |
| `multi-target-proxy.md`, `deployable-networking.md`, `kubernetes-helm.md`, `terraform-iac-target.md`, `java-backend.md` | PROPOSED / DEFERRED | Deployment, networking, and backend-matrix follow-ons |

## In scope

- Type-system family: aggregate-inheritance, payload-transport-layer,
  exception-less, criterion, partial-update, load-specifications,
  type-system-overview, implementation-plan.
- Storage & platform-config + plan + micro-plan.
- Layout housekeeping: src-ir-phase-reveal,
  test-layout-and-macro-consolidation.
- Access control: authorization, multi-tenancy-design-note,
  policies-supplementary-note (background).
- Provenance / governance backbone: execution-context, provenance
  (extend), audit-and-logging (promote), sensitivity-and-compliance
  (phases 2/3/4), observability (no work), encrypted-at-rest
  (deferred final).
- UX / output: pagination-design-note, lifecycle-operations,
  loom-forms, i18n-strings, i18n.
- Workflow: workflow-and-applier (new on main).

Out of scope (per maintainer): `mutation-testing.md`.

## Known undecided issues (block grammar work, not this plan)

- **Storage keyword overload.** The storage proposal currently uses
  `storage` for **two** distinct concerns: physical resources
  (`storage pg { type: postgres }`) and logical
  aggregate-to-physical bindings (`storage orderEvents { use: pg,
  for: [Sales.Order] }`). The maintainer has flagged this as a
  design issue — one of them should likely be a different keyword
  (candidates: `dataSource`, `persistenceBinding`). Resolved in the
  decisions conversation before Phase 1A starts.
- **i18n `defaultLocale`.** The example below writes
  `defaultLocale en` at system level. `i18n.md` does not pin this
  syntax — placeholder pending the i18n decisions phase.
- **`mask: strategy: <name>`** placeholder syntax. The sensitivity
  proposal lists masking strategies but does not pin the syntax for
  selecting one per field. Placeholder pending phase 3 of the
  sensitivity proposal.

---

## Phase 0 — Convenience & Architectural Groundwork

Strictly housekeeping + cross-cutting design specs + test scaffolding.
No new language features.

### 0.1 Decisions to pin before any grammar edit

> **Status: all RATIFIED.** Every tag below is now PINNED in
> [`../decisions.md`](../decisions.md) (D1–D4 + D14–D15 cover the
> type-system grammar surface; the rest of the type-system D-table,
> D5–D37, keeps its recommended answers in `implementation-plan.md` and
> is taken per-phase). Grammar work on the dependent proposals is
> unblocked.

- D-RENAME — header paren modifier `inheritanceUsing(sharedTable |
  ownTable)` (was `inheritanceStrategy: shareTable | ownTable`).
  Amended by D-DOCUMENT-AXIS §4 — **PINNED** in `decisions.md`.
- D-ES-TPH — Force `inheritanceUsing(ownTable)` for a
  `persistedAs(eventLog)` concrete subtype of a `sharedTable` abstract.
- D-DOCUMENT-AXIS — **PINNED**. Two per-aggregate header axes
  `persistedAs(eventLog | state)` (renames body `persistenceStrategy:`,
  hard cutover) and `normalised(true | false)` (document vs relational
  saving); `json` field type; document is not a declaration kind. See
  `decisions.md` + `document-and-json-hierarchies.md`. Depends on
  D-STORAGE-SPLIT (shares the `dataSource` `kind` set).
- D-STORAGE-SPLIT — Split the `storage` keyword overload (see "Known
  issues" above).
- Type-system D1–D4 + D14–D15 — carrier name, discriminator name,
  postfix-vs-prefix ML syntax — pinned per `implementation-plan.md`,
  locked before P3.
- D-POLICY-STYLE — Pin `policy { }` reachability over function-style.
- D-LIFECYCLE-VERB — Pin `urlStyle: literal | resource` default.
- D-I18N-KEY — Pin Option B (positional hash + named render).
- D-CTX-SHAPE — Pin the ambient `RequestContext` field set
  (see §0.4).
- D-ENVELOPE — Pin the wire envelope rule (entity | `Paged<T>` |
  ProblemDetails | event-frame).

### 0.2 Mechanical file-tree reorgs — DONE on main

- ~~`src-ir-phase-reveal.md`~~ — SHIPPED. `src/ir/` is `types/` / `lower/` /
  `enrich/` / `validate/` / `util/`; `migrations-builder.ts` moved to
  `src/system/`. `lower/` and `validate/` were further decomposed into
  per-declaration-kind / per-theme leaves (#921/#923/#930/#935, #900).
- ~~`test-layout-and-macro-consolidation.md`~~ — SHIPPED. `test/` mirrors
  `src/` phases; macros consolidated under `src/macros/`.

### 0.3 Seam extractions

- ~~Walker-target extraction~~ — DONE on main; cite for reuse.
- ~~Split `src/ir/lower-expr.ts`~~ — DONE. Now `lower-expr.ts` /
  `lower-stmt.ts` / `lower-types.ts` under `src/ir/lower/`, alongside the
  per-declaration-kind leaves.
- ~~`render-expr.ts` unification~~ — DONE (`render-expr-target-unification.md`;
  `ExprTarget` + `renderExprWith`). Backend emit monoliths also split:
  .NET `cqrs-emit`→`cqrs/{dtos,commands,queries,controller}` (#869),
  Phoenix `domain-emit`→`domain/{predicates,actions}` (#912).
- Split `src/generator/typescript/repository-builder.ts` (~1,125 LOC) into
  `eager-load-builder.ts`, `transaction-boundary-builder.ts`,
  `change-events-builder.ts`, `repository-imports-builder.ts`. *(still open)*
- PlatformSurface lifecycle hooks — extend `src/platform/surface.ts`
  with optional `emitAuthGate`, `emitAuditInit`,
  `emitCompliancePolicy`, `emitTenancyFilter`, `emitI18nAdapter`. *(still open)*

### 0.4 Cross-cutting design specs (`docs/architecture/*.md`)

> **Status: WRITTEN.** All six specs live under
> [`../architecture/`](../architecture/) (index at
> `architecture/README.md`). They are design intent; each notes its
> current-vs-target implementation state inline.

- `request-context.md` (D-CTX-SHAPE) — single ambient `RequestContext`
  shape consumed by execution-context, multi-tenancy, authorization,
  sensitivity declassification, i18n, audit, observability.
- `wire-envelope.md` (D-ENVELOPE) — entity | `Paged<T>` |
  ProblemDetails | event-frame.
- `modifier-propagation.md` — propagation rules for aggregate-level
  modifiers (`sensitive`, `provenanced`, `audited`, tenant-scope,
  `mask:`, `authorized`).
- `diagnostic-catalog.md` — central error code registry.
- `cli-surface.md` — `ddd` sub-command extension model.
- `coordinated-rebaseline.md` — operational guide for M1 / M2 / M3 /
  Lifecycle-1 / Inheritance fixture rebaselines.

### 0.5 Test infrastructure

(Deferred — judged not worth the ceremony for the structural work
that 0.2 / 0.3 cover. Per-PR verification is "run the suites; no
fixture drift".)

### 0.6 Process

- Decision-log file at `docs/decisions.md` covering all D-tags.
- PR-type taxonomy: `grammar:`, `ir:`, `gen-<platform>:`,
  `rebaseline-<tag>:`, `docs:`, `infra:`.

## Phase 1 — Three parallel foundation tracks

### 1A. Storage & platform-config foundation

`storage-and-platform-config-micro-plan.md` F1–F8, scoped as delta on
top of already-landed top-level `storage { type }`. F1 (six small
PRs, non-emitting), F2 (validator + capability matrix), F3 (adapter
contracts — pivot point), F4–F7 (downstream + per-backend seam
refactors), F8 (override + outbox).

Depends on D-STORAGE-SPLIT resolved in §0.1.

### 1B. Lifecycle-operations + loom-forms

`OperationIR` reshape — explicit `kind ∈ {create, operation, destroy}`
tag. Phase 1 grammar+IR+validator → Phase 2 urlStyle+enrichment →
Phase 3 per-backend route emission (parallel across 4 backends) →
Phase 4 crudish reframing → Phase 5 scaffold alignment. Then forms
F1 (primitives bound to typed actions) → F2 (API client wiring) →
F3 (design-pack polish). Reuses already-shipped `component`
ModelMember, slot-typed params, and HEEx form primitive slices A–D.

### 1C. Aggregate inheritance (Track I)

Independent. Uses renamed `inheritanceStrategy:` from §0.1.

---

## Phase 2 — Type-system family

Follows `docs/proposals/implementation-plan.md`. Three serial
sub-tracks + parallel-able fourth, gated by M1, M2, M3.

- 2.1 Payload-transport (P-track) — P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. **M1**: P3 +
  P4 ship together.
- 2.2 Exception-less (A-track) — A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7a.
  **M2**: A1+A2+A3 together. **M3**: A4 alone with coordinated
  fixture re-baseline.
- 2.3 Criterion (Crit-track) — Crit1–4 + Crit5 (private workflow +
  workflow-calls-workflow).
- 2.4 Folded: `partial-update.md` into A1; `load-specifications.md`
  into P3.

---

## Phase 3 — Provenance & Governance Family

Audit-driven — deltas only for already-shipped pieces.

- 3.0 `execution-context.md` (Tier 0) — compiler-emitted scope
  frames. Backbone for audit + future provenance/log extensions.
- 3.1 Tier 1 — audit promotion (`audited(actions|access|events|off)`,
  `AuditRecord`, before/after, Mediator behaviour, access-audit
  pipeline) + sensitivity phases 2/3/4 (`authorized(<tag>,…)`,
  `mask:` DTOs, sink-call classification).
- 3.2 Tier 2 — `multi-tenancy-design-note.md` then
  `authorization.md` phases 1–4 (DataKey infra → `policy { data { } }` reachability → operation/view/workflow gates → backend parity).
  Wires `policyDecisionId` into Tier 1 audit records.

---

## Phase 4 — i18n + Pagination

- 4.1 `i18n-strings.md` → `i18n.md` phases 1–7.
- 4.2 `pagination-design-note.md` — `Paged<T>` + `unpaged` +
  page-aware React hooks.

---

## Phase 5 — Deferred tail

- Authorization phases 5–7 (`exists`, field rules, `implies`).
- Provenance v1 across .NET / Phoenix.
- Audit module-wide config.
- `encrypted-at-rest.md`.

---

## Coordinated single-PR moments

| Tag | What | Phase | Reason |

## Parallelisation

Two-agent split:

- Agent A — Phase 0 seams → Phase 1A (storage) → Phase 2 → Phase 3.2 (auth).
- Agent B — Phase 0 reorgs → Phase 1B (lifecycle + forms) and/or 1C (inheritance) → Phase 3.0 → Phase 3.1 → Phase 4.

Storage post-foundation streams (A–O) absorb additional implementers
after F3.

## Critical files (cross-phase)

- Grammar: `src/language/ddd.langium`.
- Validators: `src/language/ddd-validator.ts`,
  `src/language/validators/*`.
- Type system: `src/language/type-system.ts`.
- IR: `src/ir/types/loom-ir.ts` (post-reorg), `src/ir/lower/*`,
  `src/ir/enrich/enrichments.ts`, `src/ir/validate/validate.ts`,
  recently-landed `src/ir/wire-types.ts`.
- Generators: `src/generator/<platform>/render-expr.ts`,
  `render-stmt.ts`, `emit/*.ts`, `*-builder.ts`. Reuse
  `tsxTarget` / `heexTarget`.
- Platform surface: `src/platform/surface.ts`, `registry.ts`,
  `<backend>.ts`.
- Already-shipped seams to extend, not rebuild:
  `src/generator/_obs/log-events.ts`,
  `src/generator/_obs/render-{hono,dotnet,phoenix}.ts`,
  `src/platform/hono/v4/observability-builder.ts`,
  `src/system/loomsnap.ts`, `src/ir/prov-id.ts`,
  `src/cli/main.ts` (`ddd snapshot`),
  `src/generator/_walker/target.ts` + `tsxTarget` + `heexTarget`.

## Verification

- Phase 0 — `npm test` + every `LOOM_*_BUILD=1` gate green; fixtures
  byte-identical.
- Phase 1A — F1/F2 parser+validator tests; F3–F8 byte-identical.
- Phase 1B — lifecycle parser+validator+per-backend route tests;
  forms walker-target-contract; coordinated fixture re-baseline.
- Phase 1C — inheritance parser+per-backend repository tests.
- Phase 2 — M3 coordinated re-baseline; OpenAPI parity; wire-spec
  diff reviewed.
- Phase 3 — extend `LOOM_OBS_E2E_*=1`; integration tests for
  audit-record shape, policy-decision-id linking, sensitivity
  narrowing, tenancy isolation.
- Phase 4.1 — `ddd i18n sync` round-trip on a fixture catalog.
- Phase 4.2 — pagination list-endpoint + React hook + cache test.
- Phase 5 — encrypted-at-rest gated on storage capability matrix.

## Appendix — Kitchen-sink example (DRAFT)

> **Known issues** (must be resolved before this example compiles):
>
> - The `storage` keyword is used for both physical declarations and
>   logical bindings. Per "Known undecided issues" above, one of them
>   will be renamed (likely the logical binding to `dataSource` or
>   similar).
> - `defaultLocale en` is placeholder syntax not pinned in `i18n.md`.
> - `mask … strategy: partial / redact` is placeholder syntax for
>   sensitivity phase 3.
> - `text "Country name"` and `text PromoBanner = "…"` follow draft
>   `i18n.md` syntax that has not been pinned.
>
> The example is illustrative — review it as a target shape for what
> the assembled system looks like, not as compilable Loom.

Demonstrates every in-scope feature with the recommended decision
outcomes baked in. Once the issues above are resolved, lives at
