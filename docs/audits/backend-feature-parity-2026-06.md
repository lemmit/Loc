A cross-backend audit of the *generated-backend* feature surface — which
language features each backend actually emits, where the parity gates live, and
where a feature is **silently** unsupported (emits nothing without a validator
error). This supersedes [`gated-features-inventory.md`](gated-features-inventory.md)
(2026-06-03), which predates Java/Python being broken out as backends and the
Phoenix `vanilla` foundation gaining event-sourcing / document support.

The **authoritative source** for every row is the cited validator gate set in
`src/ir/validate/checks/` (and `src/util/platform-axes.ts`). The validator is
the contract: a feature a backend can't emit is a hard error there (fail-fast,
never a silent downgrade) — *except* where a backend is omitted from a gate's
checked set, which produces a silent gap (see Finding F1). When this doc and the
code disagree, the code wins.

Backends audited (the five domain-logic backends):

| Family | Platform id | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| Hono / TS | `node` | Hono + Drizzle |
| .NET | `dotnet` | ASP.NET + EF Core + Mediator |
| Java | `java` | Spring Boot + JPA |
| Python | `python` | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2 |
| Phoenix | `elixir` | LiveView + Ash **or** vanilla Ecto |

Elixir is split into its two **foundations** (`ash` default / `vanilla`) wherever
the gap is foundation-shaped, not platform-shaped.

Legend: ✓ implemented · ✗ gated (validator error) · ⚠ partial · 🔴 **silent gap**
(no emit, no gate) · N/A not applicable.

The reference platforms (node/dotnet/react) are now the **trailing** view: the
big movements since the 2026-06-03 inventory are (1) **TPH is no longer node-only
— all five backends emit it**, (2) **Java and Python reached full backend status**
(unions, carriers, `when`, returns, ES, all three saving shapes), (3) the
**Phoenix `vanilla` foundation** unlocked ES + document + provenance that the Ash
foundation still gates, and (4) **provenance landed on Java + Python** (#1490).
As of [2026-06-23] the remaining cross-cutting items also closed: (5) **per-op +
lifecycle `audited`** now ship on all four non-elixir backends + elixir·vanilla
(#1503), (6) **`ignoring` filter-bypass** is all five families incl. both elixir
foundations, and (7) **`X id[]` reference collections** were drained on both
elixir foundations (#1533 vanilla / #1551 ash) and boot-verified on all five — the
last had been an ungated 🔴 silent gap. The standing cross-backend gaps are now
foundation-shaped (elixir·ash gates ES/document/provenance/audit) rather than
backend-shaped.

## Findings

### F1 — ✅ RESOLVED (#1481/W1a) — Python capability `filter` is now gated AND the non-principal case is emitted

> **[2026-06-21 audit refresh, code-verified against #1496]** This finding,
> filed as a 🔴 silent gap, is now **resolved** on `main`. The original text
> follows for history.

On `main` today, `validateContextFilterSupport` reads
`LIMITED_FAMILIES = new Set(["node", "elixir", "java", "python"])`
(`system-checks.ts:1004`, wired at `validate.ts`). **`python` is now in the set**,
so the validator no longer treats it as fully capable. The split is precise:

- **Non-principal relational filters (W1a)** — `python` now **emits** them.
  `contextFilterPredicate` in `src/generator/python/find-predicate.ts` lowers an
  aggregate's non-principal capability filters to a SQLAlchemy predicate and
  `repository-builder.ts` AND-s it into every root read (the SQLAlchemy analogue of
  EF's `HasQueryFilter`). The grep that flagged the gap now hits:
  `grep -rn contextFilters src/generator/python/` returns
  `find-predicate.ts` (no longer zero matches).
- **Principal filters (W1b — `currentUser`/tenancy)** — still **gated** on python.
  `supportsPrincipalFilter` (`system-checks.ts:1021`) returns true only for
  node/elixir/java; python falls through to `false`, so a principal-referencing
  filter on a python aggregate is a hard `loom.*` error, not a silent no-op.
- **Non-relational-shape filters (doc/embedded)** — still **gated** on python.
  `supportsNonRelationalFilter` (`system-checks.ts:1044`) admits node (doc+embedded),
  java (doc+embedded), elixir (embedded) — python is absent, so it errors.

**Net:** the correctness hole the original finding described (a python aggregate's
reads with no WHERE scoping) is closed — the only un-emitted cases (principal,
non-relational) now fail fast at validation rather than silently emitting an
unscoped backend. python is no longer a 🔴; it's ✓ for the non-principal relational
case and ✗ (honest gate) for the rest.

<details><summary>Original finding (pre-#1481, superseded)</summary>

The capability-filter gate `validateContextFilterSupport`
(`system-checks.ts:1006`, wired at `validate.ts:118`) only inspects families in
`LIMITED_FAMILIES = {node, elixir, java}` (`:1014`). **`python` is absent**, so
the validator treats it as fully capable — yet the Python generator never
consumes `contextFilters`:

```
$ grep -rn contextFilters src/generator/python/   →  (no matches)
```

Every other backend references it (node `repository-find-predicate.ts`, dotnet
`efcore.ts`, java `entity.ts`/`repository.ts`/`criteria.ts`). The lowering
populates `AggregateIR.contextFilters` (`lower.ts:1210`) regardless of platform.

**Impact:** a `with softDelete` / tenancy `filter !this.isDeleted` /
`filter tenantId == currentUser.tenant` on a **python-hosted** aggregate passes
validation and emits a backend whose reads have **no WHERE scoping** — soft-deleted
rows are returned, and tenancy isolation is silently absent.

**Recommended fix (low-risk, fail-fast):** add `python` to `LIMITED_FAMILIES`.
(The principled fix is to emit the predicate into the SQLAlchemy reads.)

</details>

### F2 — Audit runtime is the last cross-cutting gap (provenance now closed on Java/Python)

> **[2026-06-22] Largely resolved.** Provenance shipped on Java + Python (#1490/W2):
> `PROVENANCE_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:1999), plus
> elixir·vanilla via the foundation predicate (`provenanceSupported` →
> `foundation === "vanilla"`, system-checks.ts:1158). The original "Java/Python emit
> no provenance" claim is no longer true.

> **[2026-06-23] Closed.** W3a landed (#1503): `AUDIT_OP_BACKENDS = {node,
> dotnet, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:2111) and `AUDIT_LIFECYCLE_BACKENDS =
> {node, dotnet, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:2112) — both also on
> elixir·**vanilla** via `elixirAuditCapable` (foundation === "vanilla";
> elixir·ash stays gated, like provenance/ES). So per-op AND lifecycle `audited`
> now ship on all four non-elixir backends + vanilla; the "audit runtime" gap is
> no longer cross-cutting — only elixir·ash remains gated (a foundation fit, not a
> port). The text below is the superseded 2026-06-22 state.

What remained (2026-06-22): `AUDIT_OP_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet}` and
`AUDIT_LIFECYCLE_BACKENDS = {node}`. Java and Python still gated per-operation
`audited` (fail-fast, good) — closing that was **W3a, in flight** (#1503, since
merged). Lifecycle `audited` (`audited create`/`destroy`) was node-only. So the
cross-cutting/compliance gap had narrowed from "provenance + audit on two
backends" to "per-op audit on two backends, with the PR open" — now resolved.

### F3 — Elixir foundation split is the dominant elixir story

Three features are gated on `elixir·ash` but ship on `elixir·vanilla`:
event-sourced **aggregate** storage, `shape(document)`, and provenanced fields.
Event-sourced **workflows** (saga appliers) are gated on **both** elixir
foundations (`EVENT_SOURCING_WORKFLOW_BACKENDS` omits elixir entirely) — the
saga emitters key off `correlationField` and would misgenerate a state-based
saga. Exception-less returns are per-op on ash (return-dominant actions only;
mutate-then-return / guarded bodies defer to vanilla).

> **[2026-06-22]** This split is now a *documented contract*, not loose debt:
> #1496/W4 formalized Phoenix foundation routing (see `docs/platforms.md`) — a
> feature ash can't idiomatically emit is reached by routing the deployable to
> `vanilla`, which is the intended end state, not a gap to close on ash.

### F4 — Documentation drift *(resolved)*

> **[2026-06-22] Both items resolved.** `gated-features-inventory.md` now carries a
> "Superseded (2026-06-21)" banner pointing here. `docs/generators.md` now uses the
> three reference platforms (TS/.NET/React) for matrix readability **with an explicit
> note that each row maps to Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot, and Elixir/Phoenix**
> (generators.md:35-37) — a deliberate readability choice, not a deferral, so a full
> column-per-backend rewrite is no longer warranted.

Original concern: the generators.md matrix only broke out TS/.NET/React with the
other backends deferred to prose, and the stale `gated-features-inventory.md` had no
superseded marker.

## Per-feature detail

### 1. Persistence & storage

- **Event-sourced storage** — `EVENT_SOURCING_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, python,
  java}` (system-checks.ts:1849). Elixir is foundation-shaped: `vanilla` emits the
  `<agg>_events` stream + fold (`elixir/vanilla/eventsourced-emit.ts`), `ash` is
  gated (`loom.event-sourcing-backend-unsupported`) — no pure-ES Ash fit.
- **Saving shapes** — `PLATFORM_SAVING_SHAPES` (platform-axes.ts:40): node/dotnet/
  java/python all carry `[relational, embedded, document]`; elixir base set is
  `[relational, embedded]`, with `document` un-gated only on `vanilla`
  (`elixir/vanilla/document-emit.ts`, DEBT-07).
- **Inheritance** — TPC (`ownTable`) universal. TPH (`sharedTable`, the
  omitted-modifier default) is now `TPH_CAPABLE = {node, dotnet, elixir, python,
  java}` (system-checks.ts:1798) — **the headline change from the prior audit,
  which had it node-only.** Mixed-strategy override and polymorphic `Base id` → TPC
  base stay rejected everywhere (language/validators/inheritance.ts).

### 2. Query / payload surface (all five backends ✓)

Discriminated unions, generic carriers (`paged`/`envelope`), and the `when`
canCommand gate are uniform across node/dotnet/java/python/elixir
(structural-checks.ts:414/232/484). The `when` gate's check is now latent (all
five emit it) and stands as a safety net for any future backend.

### 3. Exception-less returns

`SUPPORTED_RETURN_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, python, java}` (structural-checks.ts:
518). Elixir is per-op (structural-checks.ts:525): `vanilla` handles every
returning op; `ash` handles return-dominant ops (a generic action) plus in-memory
mutation + `precondition`/`requires` guards — `emit`/`add`/`remove` bodies still
defer to vanilla (DEBT-03).

### 4. Capability filters

`LIMITED_FAMILIES = {node, elixir, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:1004). Principal
(`currentUser`) filters on relational aggregates are wired on node, elixir (both
foundations), java, and dotnet (EF `HasQueryFilter`, ungated). Non-relational-shape
filters: node + java (document + embedded), elixir (embedded only); principal +
non-relational stays gated everywhere. **dotnet** is ungated because it genuinely
supports the full surface; **python** now emits the non-principal relational case
(W1a — `contextFilterPredicate` in `find-predicate.ts`, AND-ed into every root read)
and gates principal (W1b) + non-relational filters — see **F1** (resolved #1481).

**`ignoring <Cap>` filter-bypass** (#1501): a read may carry an `ignoring *` /
`ignoring <Cap>` clause that drops a specific capability filter from that read.
`FILTER_BYPASS_FAMILIES = {dotnet, node, elixir, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:1199)
— **all five families** now honor it (EF `IgnoreQueryFilters`; Drizzle omits the
bypassed conjunct; Ecto omits the bypassed `where:`; java/python omit the
predicate). Elixir honors it on **both** foundations: vanilla omits the `where:`,
ash promotes the capability out of `base_filter` and applies it per-read minus the
bypassed reads (§11.6). _([2026-06-23] widened from the 2026-06-22 `{dotnet, node}`
+ vanilla; java/python/ash were deferred then.)_

### 5. Provenance & audit

`PROVENANCE_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, java, python}` (system-checks.ts:2050) +
elixir·vanilla via the foundation predicate (`foundation === "vanilla"`). As of
[2026-06-23] audit caught up to provenance: `AUDIT_OP_BACKENDS` and
`AUDIT_LIFECYCLE_BACKENDS` are both `{node, dotnet, java, python}`
(system-checks.ts:2111-2112) + elixir·vanilla (`elixirAuditCapable`). So provenance
**and** per-op/lifecycle audit now ship on all four non-elixir backends + vanilla;
only elixir·ash stays gated for both (a foundation fit, like ES storage). See **F2**.

### 6. Audit / context stamping (`contextStamps`)

Not gated — co-hosting is allowed. All five backend generators now reference
`contextStamps` (dotnet 7 files, java/python/elixir 2 each, node via a shared
helper), where the 2026-06-03 inventory recorded runtime parity as node-only with
dotnet/phoenix "parsed, parity deferred." The breadth has grown; full *runtime*
equivalence (e.g. principal-referencing stamp values, lifecycle hooks) still
varies per backend and is worth a dedicated runtime conformance pass rather than a
static-reference count.

### 7. `X id[]` reference collections

> **[2026-06-23] Now emitted + boot-verified on all five backends.** This was an
> ungated 🔴 silent gap on **both** elixir foundations until a cross-backend
> sweep boot-tested it (a real-Postgres POST→GET round-trip — the only check that
> catches it, since `mix compile` passes on the broken output):
> - **elixir·vanilla** (#1533) emitted `field :party, {:array, :binary_id}` on a
>   column the migration never created → first query crashed. Fixed to an Ecto
>   `many_to_many` over the already-correct join table (preload on read,
>   `put_assoc` on write).
> - **elixir·ash** (#1551) emitted the `many_to_many`/calculate but the
>   create/update actions never wired it (POST 422), the encoder omitted it, the
>   join resource lacked the schema prefix, and the read projection was a
>   single-valued calculate that crashed the `::uuid[]` cast. Fixed: create/update
>   `manage_relationship` (set-replace), encoder inclusion, join-resource `schema`,
>   and a `list` aggregate read projection.
> - **node / dotnet / java / python** were boot-verified correct in the same sweep
>   (Drizzle join select+delete+insert, EF join entity, JPA `@ElementCollection`,
>   SQLAlchemy association rows).

Ordering: node (Drizzle) / dotnet (EF) / java / python write an `ordinal` and
`ORDER BY ordinal`; elixir leaves the ordinal at default and returns Postgres
order. The **wire contract is unordered (set semantics)** — `party[0]` means
"some element," not "the first" — so per-backend ordering divergence is within
contract. Documented in `generators.md` → "What the generators don't do."

## Method notes

- Gate sets were read directly from `src/ir/validate/checks/{system,structural}-checks.ts`
  and `src/util/platform-axes.ts` — originally on `main` @ `9a5949b`, re-verified and
  line-synced @ `cf77fcf` (2026-06-22).
- A live guardrail now backs this audit: `test/platform/backend-parity-gates.test.ts`
  (#1493/W5) asserts that every (capability feature × backend) is either GATED (a
  `loom.*` error) or REALISED (an emitter marker) — "neither" (the F1 silent gap)
  fails the test. The gate sets above can no longer drift into a silent hole without
  CI catching it.
- "🔴 silent gap" is reserved for a backend that is *absent from a gate's checked
  set AND emits nothing*. F1 was such a gap at the original snapshot; #1481 (W1a)
  resolved it — python is now in `LIMITED_FAMILIES` and `grep -rn contextFilters
  src/generator/python/` hits `find-predicate.ts` (the non-principal case is emitted).
- This is a point-in-time empirical snapshot. `main` moves fast; re-derive from the
  cited lines before treating any row as current.
