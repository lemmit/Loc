# Backend Feature-Parity Audit

**Snapshot date:** 2026-06-21

A cross-backend audit of the *generated-backend* feature surface — which
language features each backend actually emits, where the parity gates live, and
where a feature is **silently** unsupported (emits nothing without a validator
error). This supersedes [`gated-features-inventory.md`](gated-features-inventory.md)
(2026-06-03), which predates Java/Python being broken out as backends and the
Phoenix `vanilla` foundation gaining event-sourcing / document support.

The **authoritative source** for every row is the cited validator gate set in
`src/ir/validate/checks/` (and `src/util/platform-axes.ts`). The validator is
the contract: a feature a backend can't emit is a hard error there (fail-fast,
never a silent downgrade) — *except* where a backend is omitted from a gate's
checked set, which produces a silent gap (see Finding F1). When this doc and the
code disagree, the code wins.

Backends audited (the five domain-logic backends):

| Family | Platform id | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| Hono / TS | `node` | Hono + Drizzle |
| .NET | `dotnet` | ASP.NET + EF Core + Mediator |
| Java | `java` | Spring Boot + JPA |
| Python | `python` | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2 |
| Phoenix | `elixir` | LiveView + Ash **or** vanilla Ecto |

Elixir is split into its two **foundations** (`ash` default / `vanilla`) wherever
the gap is foundation-shaped, not platform-shaped.

Legend: ✓ implemented · ✗ gated (validator error) · ⚠ partial · 🔴 **silent gap**
(no emit, no gate) · N/A not applicable.

The reference platforms (node/dotnet/react) are now the **trailing** view: the
big movements since the 2026-06-03 inventory are (1) **TPH is no longer node-only
— all five backends emit it**, (2) **Java and Python reached full backend status**
(unions, carriers, `when`, returns, ES, all three saving shapes), and (3) the
**Phoenix `vanilla` foundation** unlocked ES + document + provenance that the Ash
foundation still gates.

## Findings

### F1 — 🔴 Python silently drops capability `filter` predicates (correctness hole)

The capability-filter gate `validateContextFilterSupport`
(`system-checks.ts:1006`, wired at `validate.ts:118`) only inspects families in
`LIMITED_FAMILIES = {node, elixir, java}` (`:1014`). **`python` is absent**, so
the validator treats it as fully capable — yet the Python generator never
consumes `contextFilters`:

```
$ grep -rn contextFilters src/generator/python/   →  (no matches)
```

Every other backend references it (node `repository-find-predicate.ts`, dotnet
`efcore.ts`, java `entity.ts`/`repository.ts`/`criteria.ts`). The lowering
populates `AggregateIR.contextFilters` (`lower.ts:1210`) regardless of platform.

**Impact:** a `with softDelete` / tenancy `filter !this.isDeleted` /
`filter tenantId == currentUser.tenant` on a **python-hosted** aggregate passes
validation and emits a backend whose reads have **no WHERE scoping** — soft-deleted
rows are returned, and tenancy isolation is silently absent. This is precisely the
footgun the other gates exist to prevent ("a parsed-but-unemitted feature is a
footgun, so it fails fast").

**Recommended fix (low-risk, fail-fast):** add `python` to `LIMITED_FAMILIES` so a
capability filter on a python aggregate becomes `loom.context-filter-unsupported`
rather than a silent no-op. (The principled fix is to emit the predicate into the
SQLAlchemy reads — `find-predicate.ts` already lowers the same predicate subset for
`where` finds — but the safe interim is the gate.) Either way it should not stay
ungated-and-unemitted.

### F2 — Provenance / audit are the widest real parity gap

`PROVENANCE_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet}` (+ elixir·vanilla); `AUDIT_OP_BACKENDS =
{node, dotnet}`; `AUDIT_LIFECYCLE_BACKENDS = {node}`. **Java and Python emit no
provenance or audited-operation runtime** — both fail fast (good), but it means a
domain that leans on `provenanced`/`audited` can only target node/dotnet (and
elixir·vanilla for provenance). These are the two backends still materially behind
on the cross-cutting/compliance surface.

### F3 — Elixir foundation split is the dominant elixir story

Three features are gated on `elixir·ash` but ship on `elixir·vanilla`:
event-sourced **aggregate** storage, `shape(document)`, and provenanced fields.
Event-sourced **workflows** (saga appliers) are gated on **both** elixir
foundations (`EVENT_SOURCING_WORKFLOW_BACKENDS` omits elixir entirely) — the
saga emitters key off `correlationField` and would misgenerate a state-based
saga. Exception-less returns are per-op on ash (return-dominant actions only;
mutate-then-return / guarded bodies defer to vanilla).

### F4 — Documentation drift

`docs/generators.md`'s top-level matrix still only breaks out **TS / .NET /
React** and carries a scope note deferring Java/Python/Elixir/Vue/Svelte/Angular
to prose. Given those backends now pass the same gate sets, the matrix is due a
five-backend rewrite. The stale `gated-features-inventory.md` (node/dotnet/phoenix/
react only) should be marked superseded by this audit.

## Per-feature detail

### 1. Persistence & storage

- **Event-sourced storage** — `EVENT_SOURCING_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, python,
  java}` (system-checks.ts:1664). Elixir is foundation-shaped: `vanilla` emits the
  `<agg>_events` stream + fold (`elixir/vanilla/eventsourced-emit.ts`), `ash` is
  gated (`loom.event-sourcing-backend-unsupported`) — no pure-ES Ash fit.
- **Saving shapes** — `PLATFORM_SAVING_SHAPES` (platform-axes.ts:40): node/dotnet/
  java/python all carry `[relational, embedded, document]`; elixir base set is
  `[relational, embedded]`, with `document` un-gated only on `vanilla`
  (`elixir/vanilla/document-emit.ts`, DEBT-07).
- **Inheritance** — TPC (`ownTable`) universal. TPH (`sharedTable`, the
  omitted-modifier default) is now `TPH_CAPABLE = {node, dotnet, elixir, python,
  java}` (system-checks.ts:1613) — **the headline change from the prior audit,
  which had it node-only.** Mixed-strategy override and polymorphic `Base id` → TPC
  base stay rejected everywhere (language/validators/inheritance.ts).

### 2. Query / payload surface (all five backends ✓)

Discriminated unions, generic carriers (`paged`/`envelope`), and the `when`
canCommand gate are uniform across node/dotnet/java/python/elixir
(structural-checks.ts:414/232/484). The `when` gate's check is now latent (all
five emit it) and stands as a safety net for any future backend.

### 3. Exception-less returns

`SUPPORTED_RETURN_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet, python, java}` (structural-checks.ts:
518). Elixir is per-op (structural-checks.ts:525): `vanilla` handles every
returning op; `ash` handles return-dominant ops (a generic action) plus in-memory
mutation + `precondition`/`requires` guards — `emit`/`add`/`remove` bodies still
defer to vanilla (DEBT-03).

### 4. Capability filters

`LIMITED_FAMILIES = {node, elixir, java}` (system-checks.ts:1014). Principal
(`currentUser`) filters on relational aggregates are wired on node, elixir (both
foundations), java, and dotnet (EF `HasQueryFilter`, ungated). Non-relational-shape
filters: node + java (document + embedded), elixir (embedded only); principal +
non-relational stays gated everywhere. **dotnet** is ungated because it genuinely
supports the full surface; **python** is ungated but emits nothing — see **F1**.

### 5. Provenance & audit

`PROVENANCE_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet}` + elixir·vanilla (system-checks.ts:1814).
`AUDIT_OP_BACKENDS = {node, dotnet}`; `AUDIT_LIFECYCLE_BACKENDS = {node}`
(system-checks.ts:1870-71). Java and Python gate all three. See **F2**.

### 6. Audit / context stamping (`contextStamps`)

Not gated — co-hosting is allowed. All five backend generators now reference
`contextStamps` (dotnet 7 files, java/python/elixir 2 each, node via a shared
helper), where the 2026-06-03 inventory recorded runtime parity as node-only with
dotnet/phoenix "parsed, parity deferred." The breadth has grown; full *runtime*
equivalence (e.g. principal-referencing stamp values, lifecycle hooks) still
varies per backend and is worth a dedicated runtime conformance pass rather than a
static-reference count.

### 7. `X id[]` reference-collection ordering

Unchanged: node (Drizzle) / dotnet (EF) / java (JPA `@ElementCollection` / join)
/ python write an `ordinal` and `ORDER BY ordinal`; elixir (Ash) leaves the
ordinal at default and returns Postgres order. The **wire contract is unordered
(set semantics)** — `party[0]` means "some element," not "the first." Documented
in `generators.md` → "What the generators don't do."

## Method notes

- Gate sets were read directly from `src/ir/validate/checks/{system,structural}-checks.ts`
  and `src/util/platform-axes.ts` on `main` @ `9a5949b`.
- "🔴 silent gap" is reserved for a backend that is *absent from a gate's checked
  set AND emits nothing* — verified for F1 by grepping the python generator for
  `contextFilters` (zero hits) against the other four backends (all hit).
- This is a point-in-time empirical snapshot. `main` moves fast; re-derive from the
  cited lines before treating any row as current.
