# Generated-code review — June 2026 (all platforms)

> Snapshot-in-time audit. A full review of generated output across all 5
> backends + 3 frontends (driven from `examples/showcase.ddd`,
> `vue-showcase.ddd`, `svelte-shop.ddd`). Each finding is dispositioned below so
> nothing is silently dropped. **Verify-first** was applied throughout — a large
> fraction of flagged items turned out to be intentional/working, and "fixing"
> them blindly would have regressed tested/reference code.

## Fixed (TDD: red generator test → fix → green, in default `npm test`)

| Area | Defect | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| Phoenix | `ViewsController` matched `{:ok, records}` against a `run/1` that returns a bare list (both foundations) → `CaseClauseError` on every view request; also a masked full-form `Map.from_struct` crash | `eae19c6` |
| React (×3) | menu external links rendered the `__external:` sentinel into a `<NavLink>`; boolean cells rendered blank; `applyServerErrors` read an axios `.response` shape the client never throws (every 422 dropped) | `ff58fa2` |
| Vue | named-layout SFC lacked the Vuetify `<v-app>` root | `a9ee4bc` |
| .NET | generated aggregate tests didn't compile (currentUser actor + void→var); `Tests/` csproj wasn't compiled by the build gate | `53ea8d1` |
| Hono | Drizzle schema id columns were `text` while the migration declared them via `idColumnType` (guid→uuid, int→integer, …) | `5abc6e2` |
| Java + Python | `workflow … transactional(serializable)` dropped the isolation level (.NET honored it) | `703e0cb` |
| Svelte | list/table `{#each x.data}` iterated `T[] \| undefined` → likely `svelte-check --fail-on-warnings` CI break | `825ee3e` |
| .NET | `ValidationBehavior` shared one `ValidationContext` across validators run concurrently (`Task.WhenAll`) — latent FluentValidation data race; each validator now gets its own | `600008d` |
| Hono + Python | containment-part FK drifted from the shared SQL migration: ORM index named `<table>_parent_id_idx` (vs the migration's real-column name) + Hono missing `.references()` | `600008d` |
| Walker (all frontends + HEEx) | `Image { "/logo.png" }` positional arg dropped → bare `<Image />`; now feeds `src` | `e94f4b5` |

Plus: tightened the over-claiming showcase status-contract comment, pinned the
two-tier error→status mapping, and the [runtime-conformance-harness](../plans/runtime-conformance-harness.md)
plan (Tier-0 fast source assertions, Tier-1 runtime conformance).

## Verified NOT a bug — intentional / consistent / working (left untouched)

- **Invariant/`check` → 400 (not 422)** at the domain floor — the shipped
  two-tier model (`validation-error-extension.md`): field validation → 422 with
  `errors[]`, aggregate `DomainError` → 400. The showcase's `toThrow(422)` cases
  are all field-mirrorable.
- **Vue realtime "missing"** — vue-showcase targets a **dotnet** backend, which
  doesn't serve the realtime wire; skipping the EventSource client is correct
  (svelte-shop targets hono, hence it emits one).
- **Phoenix `record.` in Ash `expr`** — the CI-compiled flagship `acme-lv`
  emits `expr(record.label)`; Ash 3.x resolves it. Established pattern.
- **Python `decimal` → `float`** — deliberate (`dispatch-builder.ts`): `decimal`
  → `float`, `money` → `Decimal` + `Numeric(19,4)`.
- **Java regex `.find()`** — matches the reference TS backend's JS `.test()`
  (substring) semantics; `.matches()` would diverge for unanchored patterns.
- **Hono `z.coerce.boolean()` on the body** — documented, consistent coercion
  strategy across the whole request-primitive table (int/long/decimal/datetime
  /bool); `.default(false)` is for cross-backend required-set parity.
- **Synthesized `inspect()` placeholder (`[string?]`, `[Pipeline[]]`)** —
  documented scope limit in `synthesizeInspect`: optionals/arrays/entity-refs
  render a type-shorthand placeholder (keeps the expression bounded + nil-safe).
  Scalars render real values.

## Real but runtime-cosmetic (no behavioral impact)

_(The Hono/Python part-FK index drift that was here is now FIXED — see `600008d`
above. It was runtime-cosmetic but aligned for cleanliness / no-debt.)_

## Remaining — genuine but unverified here (need a toolchain / are feature-sized)

These were flagged by the review; each needs runtime/toolchain verification this
environment lacks (no Elixir/Ash, no dotnet SDK, docker daemon down), or is a
walker-feature rather than a quick emitter fix. Recorded so they aren't lost:

- **React** `ProjectDetail` drops its `state` block (inert detail page) — a
  walker limitation (Modal/state in detail bodies), feature-sized; page-level
  `requires currentUser.role` not enforced client-side (backend still 403s —
  a frontend-acl feature). `Avatar { "P" }` still drops its positional arg —
  ambiguous (fallback-initials vs src) + undocumented, left for the language
  owner. (`Image`'s positional `src` is now FIXED — `e94f4b5`.)
- **Phoenix** (needs Ash compile to confirm): workflow `add_pipeline_project`
  called map-style vs positional; `requires` guard dereferences a possibly-nil
  actor; `manage_relationship` passes a struct where a map is idiomatic;
  side-effects in a `change` body vs `after_action`; `created_at` +
  `timestamps()` type overlap.
- **.NET** `RegisterProject` 403s with the shipped dev stub (empty permissions,
  admin role) — documented "replace the stub" gap; non-unique `byName`/`byHandle`
  index vs single-row finder intent.

## Method note

The fast generator-string assertion layer (now ~13 new tests) catches every fixed
defect in plain `npm test` with no toolchain — the recurrence net the harshness
of the original escape (contract asserted but never executed) motivated.
