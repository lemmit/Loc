# Design-system packs — author's guide

> Status: contract documented; Mantine and shadcn are the reference
> implementations.

A **design-system pack** is the unit of pluggable UI in Loom's React
generator.  When a user writes `design: <name>` in a `.ddd` source's
`deployable webApp { ... }` block, the React generator loads that
pack and renders every UI surface (pages, forms, tables, cells) through
it.  Built-in packs are `mantine` and `shadcn`; custom packs are any
directory the user points the slot at.

This document is the contract.  If you're writing a third design pack
— for Material UI, Chakra, your in-house system, whatever — this is
what you must satisfy.

## 1. Repository layout

The generator sees three categories of template directories at the
repo root:

```
designs/{mantine,shadcn,...}/    # one directory per design pack
vite/                            # pack-agnostic Vite scaffold (shared)
api/                             # pack-agnostic API integration (shared)
docker/                          # pack-agnostic deployment artifacts (shared)
```

A pack is a single directory under `designs/` (or anywhere on disk for
user packs) containing one `pack.json` manifest plus one `.hbs` file
per logical name in the manifest's `emits` map.

The three sibling directories (`vite/`, `api/`, `docker/`) supply
templates the pack inherits for free — see §6.

## 2. The `pack.json` manifest

```json
{
  "name": "mantine",
  "version": "v9",
  "format": "tsx",
  "stack": "v3",
  "emits": { "<logical-name>": "<file-name.hbs>", ... },
  "imports": { "<logical-name>": [{ "from": "...", "named": [...] }], ... },
  "shellFiles": { "<logical-name>": "<output-path>" },
  "shellGlobs": { "<glob>": "<output-pattern>" },
  "helpers": { "lucide": { "IconPlus": "Plus", ... } }
}
```

A pack manifest declares **what to emit** (`emits`, `shellFiles`,
`shellGlobs`), **what to import** in the emitted code (`imports`,
`helpers`), and **which cross-cutting stack** to ride (`stack`).  The
stack carries React / router / Zod / Vite versions; see [§ 2a Stacks
and how a pack picks one](#2a-stacks-and-how-a-pack-picks-one) below.

### `format`

Optional, defaults to `"tsx"`.  Discriminates the output language the
pack's templates produce — `"tsx"` for React/Mantine/shadcn-style packs
(Handlebars over `.hbs` files yielding TSX); `"heex"` for Phoenix
LiveView packs (Handlebars over `.heex.hbs` files yielding HEEx, e.g.
the built-in `ashPhoenix` pack).

The Handlebars compiler is content-agnostic, so `format` does not
change template compilation.  It DOES gate which repo-root shared
template directories the loader pulls in:

| Format | Shared dirs read |
|---|---|
| `tsx` (default) | `vite/`, `api/`, `docker/` |
| `heex` | `phoenix/` (future; empty in v0 — `ashPhoenix` ships its shell files directly) |

A pack's filename convention should match its format (`*.hbs` for tsx,
`*.heex.hbs` for heex), but the loader keys off the manifest's
`emits` paths verbatim — this is convention, not enforcement.

### `name`, `version`
Display strings.  The generator does not use `name` for resolution
(directory name + DSL slot value drive that); it surfaces in error
messages.

### `emits` — required
Map of logical template name → filename, relative to the pack
directory.  Every logical name the generator needs MUST appear here.
The loader throws on missing entries; it does not silently fall back.
See §3 for the full list of required logical names.

### `imports` — optional
Per-primitive map declaring what the generated code must import to use
that primitive.  Used by the body-walker: when the page metamodel
references a `stack`, the walker calls `primitive-stack` and looks up
this map to know which package the named exports come from.

```jsonc
"imports": {
  "primitive-button": [{ "from": "@/components/ui/button", "named": ["Button"] }],
  "primitive-card":   [{ "from": "@/components/ui/card",   "named": ["Card", "CardContent", "CardHeader", "CardTitle"] }]
}
```

Mantine maps almost every primitive to `@mantine/core`; shadcn maps
them to local `@/components/ui/*` paths (because shadcn ships
components as source — see `shellGlobs`).

### `shellFiles` — optional
Pack-specific files emitted as part of the project shell, declared by
logical name → output path.  Used for one-off files like
`tailwind.config.ts` or `postcss.config.js` that a pack needs but
aren't a regular template emission.

```json
"shellFiles": {
  "tailwind-config": "tailwind.config.ts",
  "postcss-config":  "postcss.config.js",
  "globals-css":     "src/globals.css",
  "lib-utils":       "src/lib/utils.ts"
}
```

### `shellGlobs` — optional
Glob-pattern → output-pattern map for emitting multiple files of the
same kind.  shadcn uses this to copy its 14 `components-ui-*.hbs`
templates to `src/components/ui/<name>.tsx`:

```json
"shellGlobs": {
  "components-ui-*": "src/components/ui/{1}.tsx"
}
```

The `{1}` substitution is the capture from the `*` in the input glob.
Mantine doesn't use this because its components come from an npm
package, not source files.

### `helpers` — optional
Pack-specific lookup tables consulted by helpers in templates.  Today
the only registered helper is `lucide`, used by the shadcn pack to
translate Tabler-style icon names from the DSL (`IconPlus`) to
Lucide's names (`Plus`).

### `stack` — required for `tsx` packs

Identifier of the **stack** the pack rides — a coherent React +
router + Zod + Vite + TypeScript dep bundle shipped under
`stacks/<id>/` at the repo root.  This separates *what UI library you
use* (the pack) from *what underlying runtime you build against*
(the stack).  See [§ 2a](#2a-stacks-and-how-a-pack-picks-one).

## 2a. Stacks and how a pack picks one

Multiple pack families (mantine / shadcn / mui / chakra) all run on
React.  Rather than each pack restating its React / router / Zod /
Vite versions independently — which used to drift and cause
upgrade pain — the project ships a small set of **stacks** under
`stacks/<id>/` and every pack declares which one it rides.

| Stack | React | Router | Zod | TypeScript | Vite | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `v1` | 18 | `react-router-dom@^6` | 3 | 5.7 | 5 | (none currently — older pack versions historically rode it) |
| `v2` | 19.2 | `react-router-dom@^6` | 3 | 5.7 | 5 | (intermediate) |
| `v3` | 19.2 | `react-router@^7` | 4 | 5.7 | 5 | every pack version currently shipped |

Each stack ships:

```
stacks/<id>/
├── stack.json                  # id, description, deps map, bundler hints
├── stack-package-deps.hbs      # dep names + ranges injected into the pack's package.json
└── stack-package-devdeps.hbs   # devDep names + ranges injected into the pack's package.json
```

`stack.json` also carries **bundler hints** consumed by the playground
sandbox (`rdcShim`, `importmapReactDomQuery`) so an in-browser preview
of the same pack stays consistent with what the generated `npm install`
would produce.

### How `stack` flows through the pipeline

1. Pack manifest declares `"stack": "v3"`.
2. The pack loader (`src/generator/_packs/`) resolves
   `stacks/v3/stack.json` + the two `*.hbs` snippets.
3. When the bundler renders the pack's `package-json.hbs`, it
   injects the stack's deps/devDeps into the emitted `package.json` —
   the pack's own `package-json.hbs` only lists *pack-specific* deps
   (e.g. `@mantine/core`, not `react`).
4. The same stack id is forwarded into the React generator so seams
   that swap by stack (e.g. `react-router-dom` vs `react-router`) pick
   the right import path.

### Authoring rule

A pack version's `package-json.hbs` MUST NOT restate framework deps
already covered by its stack (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-router*`,
`zod`, `typescript`, `vite`).  Restating them creates drift between
the package.json the bundler emits and the stack's intent.  The
validation step ([§ 8](#8-validating-your-pack)) flags overlap.

## 3. Required emits

The generator dispatches the following 80+ logical names.  Every pack
must emit a file for each.  Logical names are conceptual contracts;
the .hbs file behind each can render whatever the design system needs
to fulfill the contract.

### Project shell (3)

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `theme` | TS module exporting the design system's theme tokens.  May be a stub if the pack handles theming elsewhere (e.g. shadcn projects tokens into `globals.css`). |
| `main` | App entrypoint.  Mounts React, sets up the router, wraps `<App>` in pack-specific providers (e.g. `<MantineProvider>` or `<Toaster>`). |
| `package-json` | `package.json` for the generated app.  Declares pack-specific dependencies. |
| `tsconfig` | `tsconfig.json`.  shadcn adds path mappings for `@/*`. |
| `vite-config` | `vite.config.ts`.  shadcn adds Vite resolver alias for `@/*`. |
| `format-helpers` | Per-pack runtime helpers (`IdValue`, `DateTimeValue`, `BoolValue`, `NumberValue`, `EmptyValue`, `KeyValueRow`).  Output written to `src/lib/format.tsx`. |
| `app-shell` | App-shell layout: navbar/sidebar/main outlet. |
| `home` | Home/dashboard page. |

### Page templates (4)

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `page-list` | Aggregate list page: header + create button + table + empty/error/loading states. |
| `page-detail` | Aggregate detail page: header + breadcrumbs + identity block + parts/operations. |
| `page-new` | Aggregate creation page: react-hook-form scaffold. |
| `operation-modal` | Modal/dialog rendering for aggregate operations. |

### Workflow + view templates (4)

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workflow-form` | One workflow's form page. |
| `workflow-index` | All-workflows index page. |
| `views-index` | All-views index page. |
| `view-table` | One view's tabular page. |

### Field-input templates (10)

One per primitive type the DSL can declare as an input on a creation
or workflow form.

| Name | DSL type |
|---|---|
| `field-input-string` | string |
| `field-input-int` | int |
| `field-input-decimal` | decimal |
| `field-input-bool` | bool |
| `field-input-datetime` | datetime |
| `field-input-id-select` | id (from a known aggregate, dropdown) |
| `field-input-id-text` | id (raw text input fallback) |
| `field-input-enum-select` | enum |
| `field-input-valueobject` | value object (recursive) |
| `field-input-array` | array of any of the above |

### Field-row templates (8)

Field-rows render an aggregate's fields on the detail page.  Each
wraps `<KeyValueRow>` from `format-helpers`.

| Name | DSL kind |
|---|---|
| `field-row-string` | string |
| `field-row-id` | id |
| `field-row-id-link` | id with aggregate link |
| `field-row-datetime` | datetime |
| `field-row-bool` | bool |
| `field-row-number` | int / decimal |
| `field-row-enum` | enum |
| `field-row-valueobject` | value object (recursive) |

### Cell templates (8)

Cells render an aggregate's columns on the list page and view tables.
Each wraps the pack's `<TableCell>`-equivalent.

| Name | DSL kind |
|---|---|
| `cell-string` | string |
| `cell-id` | id |
| `cell-id-link` | id with link |
| `cell-row-id-link` | row-level id link |
| `cell-datetime` | datetime |
| `cell-bool` | bool |
| `cell-number` | int / decimal |
| `cell-enum` | enum |

### Aggregate piece templates (2)

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `part-table` | Table rendering aggregate "parts" (collection-of-X on the detail page). |
| `op-button` | A single operation-trigger button on the detail page. |

### Walker primitives (22)

The body-walker dispatches every page-metamodel node through these
primitives.  The walker calls `pack.render("primitive-X", vm)` and
expects the pack's template to produce design-system-appropriate JSX.

| Primitive | Use |
|---|---|
| `primitive-heading` | Section heading |
| `primitive-text` | Body text |
| `primitive-divider` | Visual separator |
| `primitive-stack` | Vertical flex container |
| `primitive-group` | Horizontal flex container |
| `primitive-toolbar` | Horizontal toolbar (group variant) |
| `primitive-grid` | Grid container |
| `primitive-container` | Width-constrained container |
| `primitive-empty` | Empty-state message |
| `primitive-button` | Action button |
| `primitive-card` | Card with title + content |
| `primitive-stat` | Stat block (label + value) |
| `primitive-badge` | Status pill / chip |
| `primitive-field` | Labeled text input |
| `primitive-toggle` | Labeled switch / checkbox |
| `primitive-number-field` | Labeled number input |
| `primitive-password-field` | Labeled password input |
| `primitive-loader` | Loading spinner |
| `primitive-anchor` | Link / `<a>` |
| `primitive-image` | `<img>` wrapper |
| `primitive-avatar` | User-avatar component |
| `primitive-tabs` | Tabs container with header + content slots |

## 4. Inherited shared sources

A pack does NOT need to emit these — the generator pulls them from
the repo-root sibling directories:

| Source dir | Logical name → output path |
|---|---|
| `vite/` | `index-html` → `index.html` |
|         | `tsconfig-node` → `tsconfig.node.json` |
| `api/`  | `api-client` → `src/api/client.ts` |
|         | `api-config` → `src/api/config.ts` |
| `docker/` | `dockerfile` → `Dockerfile` |
|           | `dockerignore` → `.dockerignore` |

A pack CAN override any of these by emitting a template with the same
logical name — the loader registers shared partials first, then pack
templates, so pack entries win on collision.  Don't override unless
you have a real reason (e.g. a pack that needs to be deployed as a
Cloudflare Worker instead of a Docker image could replace
`dockerfile` with a `wrangler-config` of its own).

## 5. Template language

Templates are Handlebars 4 (`handlebars` npm package).  The generator
registers these helpers globally:

- `expr <value>` — emits the value as a raw expression (no HTML
  escaping).  Use for JS expressions that should render as-is, e.g.
  `value={{expr valueExpr}}`.
- `json <value>` — JSON-stringifies the value.  Use for inline
  literals: `defaultRadius={{json radius}}`.
- Standard Handlebars: `{{#each}}`, `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}`,
  `{{> partial-name}}`, etc.

Every template registered via `emits` is ALSO registered as a
Handlebars partial under its logical name.  This lets higher-level
templates compose primitives:

```hbs
<form>
  {{> primitive-button label="Save"}}
  {{> primitive-button label="Cancel"}}
</form>
```

The partial dispatch resolves to whichever pack is currently loaded —
the same shared template produces Mantine output under one pack and
shadcn output under another.

`strict: true` is on.  Templates throw at render time if a referenced
field is missing from the view-model.  This is intentional: it forces
the pack and the preparer to stay in sync; missing data surfaces
immediately during tests instead of leaking blanks into output.

## 6. Distribution model: npm vs source-copy

The two reference packs illustrate the two distribution models a pack
can use:

### npm-package model (Mantine)

Components come from an npm dependency.  Each primitive's `imports`
entry points to `@mantine/core` (or similar); `package-json` declares
those packages; the generated app `npm install`s them at boot.

Pros: no source files to ship; component updates flow via package
updates; clean.

Cons: bound to the package's design decisions; pack can't customize a
single component without forking the package.

### Source-copy model (shadcn)

Components are TS files vendored into the generated project.  Each
component-ui template (`components-ui-button.hbs`,
`components-ui-table.hbs`, …) renders the source of one component;
`shellGlobs` emits each one to `src/components/ui/<name>.tsx`;
`imports` for each primitive points at the local path
(`@/components/ui/<name>`).

Pros: full ownership of every component; user can edit them after
generation.

Cons: more templates to maintain; component "updates" mean editing
your pack templates.

A custom pack can use either model or a mix.  The contract is the
same: every required logical name renders something that satisfies
the preparer's view-model.

## 7. Helpers (special-purpose maps)

The `helpers` field carries pack-specific lookup tables consulted by
generator-side code, not by templates directly.

### `lucide`

shadcn's icon library is `lucide-react`.  The DSL uses Tabler-style
icon names (`IconPlus`, `IconTrash`, …).  When the React generator
emits an icon reference, it looks up `helpers.lucide[<DSL name>]`
and substitutes the Lucide equivalent if present:

```json
"helpers": {
  "lucide": {
    "IconPlus": "Plus",
    "IconTrash": "Trash2",
    "IconCheck": "Check"
  }
}
```

Mantine doesn't need this — `@tabler/icons-react` exports the
DSL names directly.

## 8. Validating your pack

After authoring, run the following:

### Generate and tsc-compile

```sh
node bin/cli.js generate system <your.ddd> -o /tmp/test-out
cd /tmp/test-out/web_app
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Generation must succeed; tsc must report zero errors.  If templates
reference an undeclared field, tsc will catch the resulting type
error.

### Vite build

```sh
npm run build
```

This catches issues that survive `tsc --noEmit` but break bundling:
missing CSS imports, asset resolution, Tailwind config errors.

### The `LOOM_REACT_BUILD=1` gate

The repo ships `test/generated-react-build.test.ts` which does the
above for the four example systems × two built-in packs.  Add your
custom pack to its cases for ongoing coverage:

```sh
LOOM_REACT_BUILD=1 npx vitest run test/generated-react-build.test.ts
```

### Side-by-side visual check

The playground ships three storybook examples (`storybook-mantine.ddd`,
`storybook-shadcn.ddd`, `storybook-components.ddd`).  Generate yours
against the storybook examples and visually compare against Mantine
and shadcn output for the same DDL.

## 9. Architectural rules

These rules constrain pack authorship and the shared-template layer
both.  See [`audits/pack-equivalence-audit.md`](./audits/pack-equivalence-audit.md) for the empirical evidence
behind them.

1. **Low-level design-system-dependent templates stay per-pack and
   dead-simple, even with some duplication.**  Two packs both
   rendering `<Badge>{{label}}</Badge>` are not duplicating — the
   `<Badge>` resolves to different imports in each pack, so the
   shape-match is coincidental.

2. **Templates land in a shared directory (`vite/`, `api/`, `docker/`)
   only when they have ZERO design-system content.**  Pure project
   scaffold (Dockerfile, index.html, fetch wrapper) is shareable;
   anything that references a design-system component is not.

3. **"Small differences" like `<Table.Td>` vs `<TableCell>` are
   design-system identity, not duplication.**  Don't try to unify
   them.

4. **One pack, one distribution model.  But the contract is the
   same.**  The generator doesn't care whether your components come
   from npm or from vendored source; it cares whether each logical
   name renders correctly.

## 10. How a user picks your pack

In a `.ddd` file:

```
deployable webApp {
  platform: react
  design: ./path/to/your-pack    // relative to the .ddd file
  port: 3001
}
```

Or by absolute path:

```
design: /opt/loom-packs/your-pack
```

Or by built-in name (only Mantine + shadcn today):

```
design: mantine
design: shadcn
```

The loader walks up from each .ddd file's location to anchor relative
paths; built-in names short-circuit and resolve under the repo's
`designs/` directory.

## 11. Worked example — minimal pack skeleton

A truly minimal pack that just delegates everything to plain HTML
elements (no design system):

```
my-pack/
  pack.json
  theme.hbs                       # empty export
  main.hbs                        # plain React boot
  app-shell.hbs                   # <div>{children}</div>
  home.hbs
  ...
  primitive-button.hbs            # <button>{{label}}</button>
  primitive-card.hbs              # <div className="card">...
  ...
```

```json
{
  "name": "minimal",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "emits": { "theme": "theme.hbs", "main": "main.hbs", ... }
}
```

No `imports` map needed — every primitive uses plain HTML elements,
no external components to import.  No `shellFiles` / `shellGlobs` /
`helpers`.

This would still produce a working app: ugly, but type-correct, and
the contract is satisfied.
