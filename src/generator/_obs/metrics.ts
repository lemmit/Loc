// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Platform-neutral metric catalog — the single source of truth for every
// Prometheus metric the generated backends expose at `GET /metrics`.
//
// This is the `wireShape`/`log-events.ts` pattern applied to metrics: one
// neutral catalog pins each metric's stable name, type, help text, label
// set, and (for histograms) bucket bounds; per-backend renderers consume
// it so a dashboard/alert/PromQL query written once works against every
// deployable platform.
//
// Each entry pins:
//   - the stable Prometheus metric `name` (what appears on the /metrics
//     exposition and in every PromQL query),
//   - its `type` (counter / histogram / gauge),
//   - the `help` line (the `# HELP` comment on the exposition),
//   - the `labels` it carries (the label keys — never high-cardinality
//     values like ids; route templates, not raw paths),
//   - `buckets` (seconds) for histograms only.
//
// Stability: treat the catalog like a wire contract — additive changes
// (new metrics, new optional labels) are safe; renaming a metric/label or
// changing a histogram's buckets breaks downstream dashboards + recording
// rules and requires a consumer migration.  Same governance as the log
// catalog.
