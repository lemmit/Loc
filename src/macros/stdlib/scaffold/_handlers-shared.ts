// Shared selection + naming logic for the explicit application/transport
// scaffold macros (unfoldable-api-derivation.md, A3).  `scaffoldHandlers`
// (context-targeted) emits a `commandHandler` / `queryHandler` per eligible
// source (aggregate operation / create / repository find / get-by-id) and
// `scaffoldApi` (api-targeted) emits the `route` that binds to it — so the two
// MUST agree on (a) which sources are eligible and (b) the derived handler name
// / HTTP method / route path.  Both derive everything here, so a route can
// never target a handler the other macro didn't emit.
//
// A3.2 generalises the original A3 (operations only) to a DISCRIMINATED target
// set spanning three more source kinds:
//   - `create`  → commandHandler constructing the aggregate     → POST /<coll>
//   - `find`    → queryHandler running the repository find       → GET  /<coll>/<find>
//   - `getById` → queryHandler loading one aggregate by id       → GET  /<coll>/{<agg>Id}
// plus the original `operation` (unchanged: POST /<coll>/{id}/<op>).
//
// `destroy` is deliberately NOT emitted here — see the note on `handlerTargets`.
